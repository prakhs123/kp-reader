## Mode of Death
  Hindu sages give many combinations and mention how one meets with one's end. One need not apply the same strictly; it is to be modified to suit our age.

### Death through a Lion
  1. Sun and Moon in 6 or 8
  2. Mars in 4 or in 10
  3. Mercury in Jupiter's sign, Mars in the sign of Saturn

### Death through Cobra Bite or Septic or Poisoning
  1. Rahu and Venus in 10
  2. Rahu and Sun in the Navamsa of Atmakaraka and aspected by evil planets
  3. Mars in 4, Saturn in 8 and Sun in 10
  4. Saturn in 2, Moon in 4, Mars in 10
  5. Saturn, Sun and Rahu in 7

### Dog-bite
  1. Sun in 4, Jupiter and Mars in 10
  2. Malefics in 12 and 8

### Fire Accident
  1. Moon in Aries or Scorpio and hemmed in between malefics
  2. Mars in 10, Sun in 4 aspected by Saturn
  3. Waning Moon in 8, Mars in 10, Saturn in 4 and Sun in 1
  4. Moon in 10, Mars in 9, Saturn in 1 and Sun in 5 - gas, smoke, carbon monoxide
### End Pleasant, Painful, Good or Bad
   Benefics, in 8th house cusp receiving beneficial aspect at birth show peaceful and pleasant end. Malefics, especially Saturn in 8th house, threaten prolonged ailment and long suffering or accident by falling down. Uranus threatens unexpected, sudden end, mostly due to accident, electrocution, sunstroke, aircrash, etc. Neptune indicates poisoning, drowning and unnatural death. Mars in 6th house-bad end. Mars in 12th house, Saturn in 8th house-dirty death. Sun with lord of Lagna in Capricorn or Aquarius-lightning or electrocution. Moon and lord of 9th house in 8th house-peaceful death. Saturn in 4th house, Moon in 7th house and Mars in 10th house, drowning. Sun and Moon in a dual sign-drowning.

Thus many yogas are given by our sages. To commit to memory and to recollect at the time of scrutiny of a horoscope is a problem, almost close to impossibility. Also, they say, find out the 22nd decanate from the Lagna and judge the characteristics of this decanate lord and predict the mode of death. Or find out the decanate occupied by lord of the 8th house. Its lord will reveal the mode of one’s end. As, at the outset, it fails in the case of births with a short interval of time between the two, like twins, the above is to be taken as a general principle alone.

But according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati one is to take that:
    - Danger is indicated during the conjoined periods and subperiods of the lord of the sign, lord of the star, the lord of the sub where the 8th house cusp falls and the lord of the constellation in which the sublord is deposited.
    - Danger shown during the conjoined period of the lord the sign, lord of the star, the lord of the sub and the lord of the constellation where the lord of the 8th house was deposited; or
    - If the sub is ruled by the benefic, promising long life or cure, even though there is danger, one will escape and survive. If the sub lord is a malefic, and a Significator of death, one will succumb to it. Jupiter sub shows pleasant end; Mars’ sudden; Saturn chronic and lingering one.

### Place of Death  
If the sublord of the 8th cusp is the significator of the houses 1, 4, and 10, it shows that the end is in his own place. If the sublord of the 8th cusp is the significator of the 3rd house, it shows that while one is making a short journey, mostly on his return journey, one passes away. If the sublord of the 8th cusp is the significator of the 6th, 8th, or 12th house, it indicates death in the jail, hospital, or an unknown place. If the sublord of the 8th cusp is the significator of the 9th house, death will happen during a long journey or in a far off place.

### Air Accident  
The horoscope of one who was born with Moon and Jupiter in Cancer, like Lord Shri Rama, having a similar name, was one of the 117 passengers by the Air India Boeing 707 reported to have crashed, is as under: The other horoscope belongs to his wife who survived him.

Male chart - Born on 2-11-1931 - Monday.
Jupiter dasa - Balance 3 years, 8 months, 28 days.
![img_83.png](img_83.png)
The following is the chart of the wife who has survived her husband.
Mercury dasa - Balance 4 years, 5 months, 24 days. By air crash it is meant (a) one has the opportunity to go by air, on a long journey (b) the unexpected end (c) in husband’s chart, a far off place. Long journey is indicated by the 9th house. Planets in the 9th house are Moon and Jupiter. Rohini, Hastham, and Sravanam are ruled by Moon. Ketu alone is in Hastham. Venus, Mercury, and Moon are in Jupiter's constellation. Mercury is lord of 9. It is in Shookshma Parivarthana yoga with Jupiter. Jupiter alone is in Mercury’s constellation. Hence, Mercury, Jupiter, Moon, Venus, and Kethu are the significators.

Find out whether there is a node occupying the sign of the significators. Rahu is in Pisces ruled by Jupiter. Hence take Rahu as the strong significator. Therefore, the conjoined periods of Mercury, Rahu, Ketu, Venus, and Moon should create a chance to go overseas. Actually he left India during Mercury Dasa, Rahu Bhukti, Venus Anthra, Saturn Shookshma, as Mercury is in 12, in his own Sub, Rahu is in Bhadhakasthana adhipathi Sun’s Sub, Venus in the constellation of Jupiter and Sub of Moon (both in 9), Saturn is in the constellation of Venus owner of 12th cusp. All these are connected with 3, 9, and 12: hence he made the journey.

Why should there be an unexpected end? Danger and death are denoted by the sublord of the cusp of the 8th house. Sublord is Jupiter, lord of 3 in 9 in the constellation of lord of 9, Mercury, who is always for travels. Venus denotes the vehicle, Mercury the travels. Hence, his end was far away from native place. As the same planets rule the Sub of 8th house there was danger.

Let us note the ruling planets then. It was a Monday ruled by Moon. The star was Sathabhisha governed by Rahu. The sign is owned by Saturn. The ascendant at that time of the crash might be 11° Capricorn, in the constellation of Moon and it would have coincided with Mercury i.e., to the place of accident, Mercury would be rising in the East then.

Why should the lady lose her husband in a far off place? She was running Venus Dasa, Mercury Bhukti, Venus Anthra. The 7th cusp is to be taken as the ascendant of the husband. Then Venus is in the constellation of lord of 6 Mercury who is in the constellation of lord of 8 Sun. This disposition is danger to husband. For her, the 8th house shows Mangalyam. It receives aspect from Mercury, Sun, and Mars. This combination indicates Mercury, during travels; Sun by fire accident; Mars, sudden end to him causing Dhur Bagyam to her.

Look at the Yogas in her chart; Chandra Mangala Yoga, Sunapha Yoga, Lagna Adhi Yoga, Nipuna Yoga, Vesi Yoga, etc. What have they done to her? Let traditional astrologers consider these and correct themselves. Is there any amangalya Yoga?

Thank you very much for your letter of May 21, 1969, in which you discussed the horoscopes of myself and my friend. Here I am amazed by the accuracy of your prediction. Your lucid and logical approach to Astrology is very impressive and certainly commendable. Some of your predictions are amazingly accurate. I did have an automobile accident in the third week of May 1968 which I escaped with no injury and damaged vehicle. Also I did buy a car around 16-2-68 as you had said. I wish to keep in touch with you and I intend to meet you when I visit India. If you should ever consider the possibility of visiting U.S.A., I shall be delighted to help you in every possible manner. I believe your trip to this country can be very interesting and rewarding if planned properly. Astrology as a hobby has helped me a lot in all walks of my life in U.S.A.

Sincerely Yours,
Mr. M. J.

### Escape from an Accident

A Friend Says

"The following is my chart. On 1-9-1962, Saturday while returning from office, a truck dashed my vehicle. I fell on the left and escaped. If I had fallen on the right, I would have been run over and crushed. Do you expect any injury or similar accident, in future?

![img_82.png](img_82.png)

Mercury dasa Balance at birth 9 years, 3 months, 5 days."

Generally people born in the sign owned by Mercury (Gemini and Virgo) will have accidents, injury, fracture, dislocation, etc. as:

- To Gemini-borns, Mars rules the 6th house and Saturn the 8th house.
- To Virgo-borns, Saturn rules the 6th house and Mars the 8th house.

Of the two signs, Virgo is the worst as Mars rules the 8th house.

On 1-9-1962, you were running Sun dasa, Mars Bhukti, Saturn anthra.

- Sun, lord of 12, in the constellation of Mars (Ashtamadhipathi) in the sub of Mercury and in the sign of Mercury causes hospitalisation and separation from family.
- Mars, lord of 8 causes danger.
- Saturn, lord of 6 in 2 gives separation from family, expenses, disease and also borrowing money.

On 1-9-1962, the day was Saturday. The Nakshathra was Uthrapalguni, governed by Sun and the Lagna was in Mars sign Scorpio, in the star of Anuradha 4th pade governed by Saturn.

As the dasanatha and bhuktinadha were in the 10th and 11th houses respectively and above the horizon, you fell on the left side. As Jupiter was aspecting Dasalord and was below the horizon, the providential aid came from right side. That is why, the truck went on the right side and you thereby escaped. If Jupiter would have been in the 9th house and above the horizon, the truck would have come on the left and would have gone at a distance. If Jupiter would have been in Lagna, the truck would have stopped just in front of you.

I had the chance to see the horoscope of my friend who had Jupiter in Lagna. He was in a scooter. The signal was red. He stopped his scooter. When the yellow light was on, he tried to start once, twice, thrice. No, it did not start. To his luck, the driver of the car in which I went, thinking that he will move, started and picked up, say, 5 miles speed. As he did not move, the car gave a push to the scooter. Ah! It started at once and my friend drove away. Even to start a vehicle when it is not perfectly all right, God helps in this manner.

As long as, well placed Jupiter aspects your Lagna, there is no fear."
### Health Disease

Good health is maintained:

1. When the cusp of the Ascendant receives good aspect from the lord of the ascendant, luminaries and other benefics.
2. When neither the cusp of the Ascendant nor the lord of the ascendant is adversely afflicted;
3. When lords of 6, 8 or 12 neither occupy Lagna, nor conjoin lord of Lagna nor form favourable aspects;
4. When lord of Lagna does not occupy 6 or 8 or 12. 

Krishnamurti Padhdhati says that:

1. If a person is born with the cusp of ascendant in the constellation of the lord of 6 or 8, he will not have sufficient immunity and resistance against infectious diseases. He is easily susceptible especially to infectious diseases and during epidemics.
2. If the sublord of the ascendant is in the constellation of significator of 6, the person will be sickly. Therefore if the ascendant and the lord of the ascendant and the sub are in the constellation of planets who are significators of houses other than 6 or 8 or 12 the native will live long; good health will be maintained.

Of the ascendant and the lord of the ascendant, the cusp is more vital. Twins are born in the same Lagna. The constellation is also the same. But it is only the sub that varies. That twin born in the sub governed by a benefic lives long and is healthy but the other though born in the same Lagna and in the same constellation suffers and dies early as the sub is governed by lord of 8 or 6.

Planets posited in the constellation of lord of 6 or in the sub of lord of 6 cause disease. Planets in any manner connected with 11th house cure the disease as the eleventh house is the 6th to the 6th. Whenever one suffers from any disease, one will be running the period of the planet connected with 6th house. He can expect the cure only during the sub period of the planet connected with Ascendant or 11th house.

To judge the nature of the disease, one is to refer to Vol. 1, where it is exhaustively dealt with and explained, what each sign signifies and what each planet indicates. Suppose one runs the periods of a planet in Scorpio in the constellation of Saturn (Anuradha) and in the sub of Moon, for the Leo-born, Sign Scorpio indicates generative system. Being the 4th house to Leo born, it shows the breast or lungs. Saturn, the lord of the constellation, denotes that it is a chronic complaint. Saturn in a watery sign or Saturn star Moon sub indicates Pustulation. Hence, boil in the breast or Pustulation in the secret parts is threatened. Gonococci infection, may be expected. If the sub belongs to Venus, it indicates Fibroid Tumour. If Jupiter rules the sub, one suffers from cancer. Mars sub warrants surgical aid. Thus having the sign, the star and the sub one has to decide the nature of the disease.

Whenever one is to know when a disease will be cured, it is to be found first of all whether there is a cure at all. Then only ascertain when it could be cured. No person can have a cure from the chronic disease, if there is no planet in 11th, no planet in the constellation of the owner or occupant of 11th house and if the 11th cusp and lord of 11th are in the sub of evil planets. 

Lepers and a few mentally deranged patients ever suffer till death. Horoscopes of such persons reveal that the lords of the dasas which they experienced after they contracted the disease are all in the sub of lord of 6 and the 11th house is not strong. Lord of 11 and 1 are also spoiled. 

People suffer from various diseases at different age. These depend on both the dasa lord and bukti lord. Planets in any manner connected with 6th house have to cause disease. Hence, in their conjoined periods they produce. The sign and the house occupied by these planets show the part of the body afflicted and the complaint.

Planets in movable signs cause disease of short duration; Common signs indicate neither short nor long. But there are chances of relapse: Fixed signs threaten disease of prolonging, chronic, loathsome and tedious nature.

Any planet can own the 6th house or occupy the constellation or sub of lord of 6. Therefore all planets are capable of causing ailment. Hence what each planet can produce, which part of the body each can affect, etc. are dealt with in Vol. I. One is to be well conversant with the diseases signified by signs and planets.
