## SIGNIFICANCE OF EACH SUB

The Zodiac is divided into 27 constellations and each constellation is subdivided into 9 parts, referred to as "subs". In this textbook, whenever "sub" is used, it means one of the 9 divisions of the star. Each star indicates many matters and when a prediction is to be offered, taking into consideration a planet and its situation in a constellation, one has to give many alternatives and hence the prediction will not be of much use to the querist. But if the sub is also included then, one can eliminate many of them and select a very few, out of the many indicated by the constellation. What each sub indicates is given below.
