## CONSTELLATION AND SUB

Since the zodiac is of 360° and is equally divided into 12 signs, each extending to 30° exactly, there will be 27 constellations in each sign, as shown below:

In Aries: Aswini, Bharani and 1/4 of Karthik;
In Taurus: Karthik 3/4, Rohini and Mrigasira 1/2;
In Gemini: Mrigasirisha 1/2, Arudhra, P Vasu 3/4;
In Cancer: P. Vasu 1/4, Pushya and Ashlesha;
In Leo: Makha, P. P Guni and 1/4 of U. P Guni;
In Virgo: U. P Guni 3/4, Hastha, Chithra 1/2;
In Libra: Chithra 1/2, Swath, Visaka 3/4;
In Scorpio: Visaka 1/4, Anuradha and Jyesta;
In Sagittarius: Moola, P Shada and U. Shada 1/4;
In Capricorn: U. Shada 3/4, Sravana, Dhanishta 1/2;
In Aquarius: Dhanishta 1/2, Sathabisha, P P Pada 3/4;
In Pisces: P P Pada 1/4, U. P. Pada, and Revathi.

Constellation needs consideration. The sign occupied by a planet is not as important as the constellation it is in. For example, if a planet is in the 12th house, it is said to cause separation, loss, and the issuing of cheques. However, this is not always the case; there can be reunion, gain, and receipt of cheques.

To illustrate, consider the following chart details: 7-52 A.M. 28-12-1900 13-04 N 80-15 E, Jupiter Dasa 3 years 1 month 6 days. This gentleman had gains, fortune, and success during Saturn, Mars, and Sun sub-periods; desirable benefits during Jupiter and Mercury sub-periods. Kethu in 10, Venus in 11, and Rahu in 4 gave untoward and undesirable results.

According to traditional system, Saturn and Sun should have been the worst, Jupiter should have been very bad, and Venus and Budha should have caused Dharma Karmadhipathi Rajayoga and given brilliant results. However, this person experienced the opposite, which opened the eyes of the observer.

In 1939, when the observer visited Coimbatore, they heard a Nadi reader reading the results of a few people in their cottage. It was understood that planets' results were read as they were found in the bhavas, without assigning the reason. The results were astoundingly accurate, but the reasons given for the future were mostly a failure.

This led to further research, collecting the horoscopes of old people with past events. It was found that a planet offers the results of the house occupied by that planet, which is the lord of the star wherein the planet is deposited.

However, trouble arose when two, three, or four planets were found in the same constellation, as all the planets in the same star, though referring to the same matters, gave diametrically opposite results. For example, if planets A, B, C, and D were in one constellation, in the same house, A and C gave pleasant results whereas B and D gave just opposite results.

Further research revealed that every constellation must be divided into nine subs and each sub having that area in a constellation in the proportion in which they are allotted the number of years in Vimshodhari dasa. It was proved that planets occupying any one constellation have a connection with the bhava occupied by the lord of the constellation. These planets in that constellation are termed as the "Significators" of the bhava occupied by the lord of the constellation. Thus, if one works out for all the planets, each planet is found to signify the matters of a few houses.

Then, judge each planet. The planet signifies a matter, and whether it votes for the progress and prosperity of that matter or, due to the sub lord, it is not capable of doing good and further does harm to that bhava signified by the planet, is to be studied. This discovery has crowned the observer with success.

If a planet is the significator of the lagna bhava, it gives long life, success in attempts, and helps to maintain good health, provided the sub lord is not the significator of 6th, 8th, or 12th house. If the sub lord of the planet signifies the 6th house and the planet shows lagna results and occupies such a sub ruled by the significator of 6th house, the native falls ill. The constellation refers to his health, and the sub signifying 6th house gives disease. 

If a planet signifies the lagna bhava and it is in the sub of the significator of 8th house, the native meets with danger. If the sub lord signifies the 12th house and the significator of lagna is in such a sub, the native runs away, is imprisoned, or hospitalized. Therefore, the constellation lord shows which matter it refers to, but the deciding factor of whether it is good or bad, successful or unsuccessful, is shown by the sub occupied by the significator.

Suppose a planet A is the significator of the second bhava and it is in the sub of 6th house, the native borrows, but if it is in the sub of 8th or 12th house, he lends to others or repays loan. If it is in the sub of 11th house, there is gain; of what? Either money or son-in-law or daughter-in-law or child birth to the person. If the significator of the second house is in the sub of the significator of 3rd house, through brother one gains, brother loses or gives away; if it is in the sub of 4th house significator, the native may have car or house during the period of the significator in 2nd house, in the sub of 4th house significator, in their conjoined periods. If the significator of the 4th house which rules the sub and if it is also the significator of 11th house, the native purchases or acquires; if the sub lord who is also the significator of 12th house other than 4th, the native sells and converts the permanent possession as liquid cash and his bank position improves by losing the car or building. If the sub lord of the planet signifying second house is the significator of 10th and 12th house, then the native lets his land for tenancy or lets the house for rent. Why? 10th house is the 4th to the 7th with whom the native transacts, so that which he takes is given by the native (12th) and he is indebted (6th).

Suppose a planet is the significator of the 7th house and if it is in the sub of 2nd or 11th house, the native gains, there is reunion, and one gets married, etc. If it is in the sub of the significator of 12th house, there is separation or health to wife. If it is in the sub of 1st and 2nd house, there is danger to partner's life. There can be 3 or 4 or any number of significators for the 7th house. Therefore, during the period or sub period of a planet in such a sub whose lord signifies 12th house, the wife falls ill or the native goes away and separation is caused. If the sub lord signifies the 6th house, the wife goes away, thereby there is separation.

If the planet signifying the 7th house is in the sub-lord of the 4th house, the partner gains, makes money and earns a name. If the signifier of the 7th house is in the sub-lord of the 5th house, the partner makes money, forms friendships and enjoys pleasure. If the sub-lord is ruled by the signifier of the 8th house, there is either income or danger to life. If the signifier of the 8th house is also the signifier of the 5th house, the partner gains. But if the signifier of the 8th house is also the signifier of the 1st and 7th house, it means death as the 8th and 1st house are maraka houses to the 7th.

Thus, one should note separately what each planet signifies and in which sub-lord each planet is posited. Finally, one should take each house and judge to which bhavas the planets are the signifiers and the sub-lords. Calmly judge how each bhava is receiving good results from a few and adverse from the rest. For example, mother is shown by the 4th house, father by the 9th house and child by the 5th house. So, note the signifiers of the 4th, 9th and 5th houses.

Chart Details: 29-1-1928 7-06 P.M. 13-04 N 80-15 E

Let us take the above chart:

Kethu Dasa balance 0-5-23.

The constellation ruled by a planet indicates the matters signified by the bhava occupied or owned by it. The sub lord occupied by a planet denotes whether it is auspicious for the progress of that Bhava or inauspicious so that one has obstacle or faces disappointment or negation of the matter. This applies to all bhava results. If the lagna is occupied by a planet or owned by one and if a planet either the same lagnadhipathi or any other planet is deposited in the occupants or owner's star, then they indicate first house matters. The depositor in that constellation is in the favourable sub, matters indicated by lagna will thrive. If the depositor in that constellation is in unfavourable sub, the matters indicated by the lord of the constellation as per its occupation or ownership will suffer.

Lord of lagna is Sun: no planet is in lagna, Sun's stars are Karthik, Uthraphalguni and Uthrashada. Planets, if deposited in these stars will refer the matters signified by first house. If there is no planet, Sun gives lagna bhava results. In the above chart, there is no planet in Sun's star. Hence Sun gives lagna results. Sun is in Moon's star. Moon is in 9 and owns 12. Hence Sun mostly refers to the matters signified by 9 and 12 i.e. long journey, staying outside, loss of father, permanent possession of father, separation from father. Let us judge the death of his father.

Note the sub occupied by Sun. It is in Jupiter's sub, what can Jupiter do to the 9th house? What can Jupiter do to the 12th house? Jupiter is in Saturn's star. As Saturn is the Bhadhakasthanaadhipathi to 9, Jupiter indicates Bhadhaka to father. Therefore if a constellation indicates father, then the sub of Jupiter in that constellation indicates danger to father. Therefore Sun in the constellation of Moon in 9 and sub of Jupiter-the Bhadhaka to father, promises danger to father.

Occupies Venus star; none in Rahu star, Mars is in the sub of Venus. So it is harmful. Rahu is in the sub of Mars; it is good. Therefore Sun, Mercury, Mars are evil. Venus is in Jupiter sub. Venus is also evil. (Venus is in the constellation of Kethu who represents 4th and 9th houses. Therefore Venus indicates those houses 9, 10 and 3 -danger to father.) His father died during Sun Dasa Mercury Bhukthi Venus Anthra in July 1952.

Let us judge 4th house. It is occupied by Sani and Kethu. It is owned by Mars. SO planets in Saturn's stars Kethu stars and Mars stars are those which refer 4th house matters. Venus in Kethu star, Jupiter in Saturn star, Mercury in Mars star indicate 4th house matters. Venus is in the sub of Jupiter, Marakasthanadhipathi and Venus is in Marakasthana to 4 (2nd from 4+). Jupiter is in Venus sub. It is evil. Mercury is in Saturn sub. As Saturn is in rapt conjunction with Kethu and Saturn is in the constellation of (Mercury, lord of 3rd from 4th) Mercury is evil. Saturn is also evil.

Now Venus, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, Moon, etc. refer 4th house matters. It is the lord of the sub which indicates whether that house matter will thrive or not. Venus is in 2 in the sub of lord of 2. Mercury in the constellation of planet in 2 to 4, owner of 4 and in sub of evil in 4. Saturn in the sub of Jupiter and Kethu in the sub of Jupiter, both occupying 4th house are evil. Hence he lost his mother during Venus Dasa Mercury Bhukthi Saturn Anthra on 27-4-47.

Let us analyse the date of death of his mother. It was on 114-47 when Venus Dasa (in the constellation of occupant of 4 and sub of the occupant of 10) Mercury Bhukthi (constellation of planet in 2 to 4 and sub of planet in 4) and anthra of Saturn which refers to the 4th house (to give life or cause death depending on the sub which Saturn occupied) and it is in the sub of Mars and Shookshma of Rahu in 10 which is also in the constellation of Mars in 2 to 4 and sub of Mars.

Day of demise: Friday. Star Moolam where Dasanatha was (Jupiter rasi Jupiter significator of 4 in Saturn star and sub of Venus in 2 to 4) at night when lagna was in Poorvashada 15° in Dhanus.

Death of child happened during Moon Dasa Jupiter Bhukthi Rahu Anthra. Moon is in the constellation of Kethu and sub of Mercury. Kethu has to give the results of planet with which it is conjoined, as it is a node. Saturn is lord of 2 to 5 and situated in 12 to 5. Hence, Moon is definitely evil as it is in the constellation of the node representing the second house to the 5th and in the sub of lord of 7 to 5, situated in 2 to 5.

Jupiter is in the constellation of Saturn, lord of 2 in 12 to 5th house and sub of Venus, which is the occupant of 5 in the constellation of node in 12 to 5. Venus itself is evil to 5. Mars in Venus star Venus sub is also evil. Rahu in Venus sign Mars star and Mars sub is definitely evil.

Hence, Moon Dasa Jupiter Bhukthi Rahu Anthra was evil.

Let us take phasantfunctons. Marriage Judge hnuses 2, 7, and 11 counted from lagna. 2, 7 and 11 are vacant. 2 is ruled by Sun, 11 is ruled by Mercury. 7 is owned by Saturn. Saturn and Kethu are in Mercury's star. Jupiter is in Saturn's star. Kethu is stronger than lord of 7. Moon and Venus are in Kethu's star. Sun is also strong as there is no planet in Sun's star. 

Marriage took place during Venus Dasa, Kethu Bhukthi, Venus Anthra, Moon Shookshma on 6-7-1947 on Sravanam star day. Venus is in Kethu's star. Kethu is stronger than Saturn, lord of 7 (7th house vacant). Kethu is in the star of Mercury (lord of 2 and 11). Both houses, vacant. Moon is in Kethu's star. Kethu is stronger than Saturn, lord of 7. Kethu has to predominantly indicate Saturn's result; then only that of Mars. Moon's star is not in Mars sign. Hence, Sravanam star governed by Moon in Saturn's sign gave marriage.

Normally when one finds Saturn and Kethu in 4 and 9th house occupied by lord of 12, one following traditional Astrology must say that the native will have no tendency towards education. Also that he cannot come up nicely in studies. But according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, Saturn and Kethu in 4 are in the constellation of Mercury, lord of if and sub of Mars owner of 4, education and 9, higher education. According to my method, if the dasanatha is connected with houses 4 and 9, they will give education. Venus in the constellation of node in 4 gave studies throughout Venus Dasa. Sun in the constellation of Moon in 9 gave higher studies. As Moon is also a significator of 12, Sun in the constellation of Moon, gave the break and ended his studies. He discontinued his studies after successfully completing Medical College course during Sun Dasa Saturn Bhukthi Sun Anthra in December, 1952.

Service
Take houses 2, 6 and 10. Sun and Mercury are in 6. Rahu is in 10. Kethu indicates what Saturn is to do, and Saturn is lord of 6. Sukra is lord of 10.
First appointment was in Sun Dasa (in 6). Saturn Bhukthi (lord of 6). Sun has no planet in its star. Hence Sun has to give surely 6th house results. Saturn in the constellation of Mercury (lord of 2) and owner of 6 has to offer. Kethu can give. Also Moon and Venus. 
Moon in Mercury sub is very strong. First appointment was in Sun Dasa Saturn Bhukthi and Moon Anthra in January, 1952. Thus various instances can be quoted.
