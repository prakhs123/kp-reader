## What each star signifies to each Lagna or Rasi borns

Normally, when we judge a horoscope, we prefer to follow the Vimshottari system and also include the Gochara (Transit). We judge the lord of the dasa, and consider him to be either favourable or not,

- by the house it occupies
- by its lordship
- by its nature
- by the planets conjoined with or aspecting the dasa lord

Further, to find out to what extent a planet is capable of bringing out the result, it is estimated according to Sadbala or as per Astagavargha. In practice, it is found that the dasa lord offers certain nature of results in its period which is not indicated by its nature, lordship or occupation in a sign or house. For example, a person born in the Ascendant Libra (Thulam) having Mars in the constellation Jyesta in Scorpio in its own sign, a fixed one, has given an opportunity to leave his kith and kin, get separated from his family, go overseas, learn how to manufacture press ink and return. Mars, as lord of 2, in the 2nd/4th house itself has to allow him, being a fixed sign, to stay in his own place. As it is neither in 9th nor in the movable, watery sign, or in 12th, normally one cannot expect overseas journey during Mars Dasa. But if one finds out in which constellation Mars was and then read out the matters signified by the lord of the constellation by its lordship, then the other results enjoyed by him will agree with the indication of the lord of the constellation to that particular lagna born. Mercury is the lord of Jyesta; it owns the houses 9th and 12th indicating overseas. Mars in Mercury star shows press, writing, printing, etc., and in a watery sign indicates ink and the results do agree in full.

In another horoscope, a gentleman born in Aquarius having exalted Saturn in the beginning of Libra (Vargothama) entered into military service during Saturn dasa. Neither Saturn nor the lord of the sign (Venus) in which Saturn was in rasi and Navamsa indicate Defence department. But if we note in which constellation Saturn was, we find that it was in Chitra ruled by Mars, which rules the 10th house and also indicates military service. Thus, in every horoscope, one can understand that a planet offers the result of the lord of the constellation more predominantly than those indicated by the sign or house which it occupies. Therefore, constellation is the main and important division of the Zodiac to read the results of a horoscope. Therefore, what results normally one can expect from a planet,

- by its occupation
- ownership
- nature

will be actually enjoyed during the periods and sub-periods of the planet in its constellation, during its own period and sub-period, the results of the lord of the constellation will predominate in addition to what it has to offer by occupation of house etc.

Hindus classify and call a planet to be good or bad according to its lordship of a sign counted from the sign where lagna falls. Westerners judge a planet whether it is favourable or unfavourable according to the nature of the aspect the planet receives and, according to its situation. But I do not attach importance to the name of the planet or its position etc. I give importance to the 27 zones in the zodiac and to the subdivisions, as these are capable of thoroughly changing a benefic (according to Hindus and Westerners) to a malefic (which is actually experienced and confirmed by the native) or changing a malefic (according to Hindus and Westerners) to a benefic (which agrees with the results enjoyed).

A father is good to his son. He may occupy a good position, say (exalted) judge; so a Sagittarius-born is confident that he will escape, whatever crime he commits. During Venus dasa the son forges a document... The case is posted under his own father. He regrets saying that his hands are tied up by the law and he punishes his own son. Sun may be a benefic by owning 9th house. It gets exalted and is in a kona. It has to do good. But during Sun dasa Kethu Bhukthi Mars anthra, the native is punished as Sun was in Aswini Star whereas Mars and Kethu were in 9. Kethu is to give the results of Mars which owns 12th house imprisonment. Therefore, the sub divisions and the stars are to be classified as good or bad: Planets cannot overrule the indications of the lord of the star and sub.

### ARIES BORNS
Aswini, Makam, Moolam: Stars are ruled by Kethu. As Kethu does not own any house, find out the planets with which it was in conjunction or by which it is aspected or the sign and constellation in which Kethu was at the time of birth. If it is not conjoined with or aspected by any planet, the results of the lord of the constellation and sign will be experienced if a planet was in any of these three stars at the time of birth or during transit in one's life time.

Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam: Venus is the ruler of the three stars. As Venus owns the second and seventh houses to Aries, the results of these two houses, i.e. second and seventh are to be predicted if any planet occupies these stars or transit in these. If Venus, at birth occupied a sign favourable to both Taurus and Libra, both the houses will be represented by Bharani trine. If Venus at birth occupied 6 or 8 or 12th sign to either Taurus or Libra and if Venus improves the matters of either of the two houses and is weak to offer the results of another house, planets occupying these stars or transiting in these stars will give such results as is denoted by Venus.

Anithigal, Uthram, Uthradam: If a planet occupies these three stars or while it moves on in these constellations, the results of the 5th house is to be predicted to Aries borns, as these stars are governed by Sun who owns Leo, the 5th house counted from the Ascendant of Aries-borns.

Rohini, Hastham, Sravanam: As Moon rules the 4th house for the Aries-borns the results indicated by the 4th house will operate while a planet transits in these three starts or if any were to be therein at the time of birth of the person. (Also 4th house matters will be offered by the planets, occupying the constellation of the planets situated in the 4th house).

Mrigasirasha, Chithrai, Avittam: Mars is the owner of these stars. Mars is the lord of 1 and 8 to Aries. So we have to presage the results of the houses 1 and 8 during the period of the planet in any of these three stars at birth or while in transit. These results will predominate. (Planets in the constellation of the occupants of these houses are very strong to give the matters of these houses).

Arudhra, Swathi, Sathabisha: Rahu is allotted these three stars by our sages. As Rahu does not own any sign, find out with which planet it is conjoined or aspected by and the sign and the constellation where it was at birth. The results of Rahu will operate when a planet was posited in these stars at birth, or when planets transit in these stars. (Rahu or Kethu will give the results of the planets with which it is conjoined then those of the planet which aspects them. Lastly, those of the lord of the sign).

Punarspusam, Visakam, Poorattathi: These three stars are governed by Jupiter who owns the 9th and 12th houses to Aries borns. You have to offer the results of the 9th and 12th houses, if a planet has occupied any of these three stars at birth whatever may be the house. When a planet transits in these stars whatever may be the nature, lordship or occupation of the transiting planet, the results enjoyed, depend on the lord of the constellation whereas the transiting planet indicates the source and explains how he gets such results. Suppose lord of 5 transits. Daughter delivers a child. The native spends money, How? 5th house is the 5th to the 5th. So, daughter will have a child. 12th house is 8th to 5th. So, she has temporary suffering. 12th house is expenses to the native. Therefore, Sun transiting in any of these stars or sub will cause expenses. If Moon transits, through mother expenses.

Pushyam, Anuradha, Uthrattathi: Saturn is allotted these three stars. If a planet were to be in these at birth or when any planet transit through these, you have to give the results of the 10th and 11th houses, as Saturn rules these houses to Aries borns. Eventhough Anuradha happens to be in the 8th sign, it is observed the Aries-borns have substantial gains when slow moving planet transit in the star Anuradha. Threatening Ashtama Sani gives pleasant shock and surprisingly good fortune.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, Revathi: Mercury who is the lord of the 3rd and 6th houses to Aries rules over these stars. Foretell the results of the 3rd and 6th houses when a planet is therein at birth or when a planet transits in these stars, whenever a particular planet transits in a particular sub in a star, the same nature of results will be experienced through the same or similar sources, the extent depending on the dasa then running.

### Taurus Borns

Aswini, Makam, and Moolam are ruled by Kethu, who does not own any sign in the Zodiac. Find out with which planet Kethu is conjoined or which planet aspects Kethu; also the sign and constellation where Kethu was at the time of birth. You have to offer the results according to the lord of the constellation and the sign which Kethu occupied if it is not conjoined with or aspected by any, if a planet were to occupy one of these three stars or transit in any of these three stars to Taurus borns.

Bharani, Pooram, and Pooradam: These stars are governed by Venus which owns the 1st and 6th house to Taurus borns. When a planet moves on in these three stars or occupy any of them at the time of birth, we have to predict the matters signified by the houses 1 and 6. For example, lord of 10 in any of these three stars gives ill health, causes enmity, offers success in competition, etc. instead of giving promotion and maintaining good relationship.

Krithigai, Uthram, and Uthradam: Sun, the major strong luminary, governs these stars and owns the 4th house to Taurus persons. If a planet is in these stars during transit or is occupying any of the three at birth, presage the 4th house matters to this native. Even when a planet transits in the 8th or 9th house in Uthradam or occupies at birth, the planet offers the results of the 4th house to the native. Suppose Mars is in Sagittarius, in Uthrashada star. As Mars is lord of 12, one may invest on an industry or factory and buy land, building etc. If Venus is there, one may have a car on hire purchase as Venus rules 6th house-debts.

Rohini, Hastham, and Sravanam: If a planet occupies any of these stars at the time of birth or transit in any we have to predict 3rd house matters to Taurus borns as Moon owns the 3rd house. Suppose Mars transits in these stars, Mars indicates as lord of 7, wife and as lord of 12, expenses; but if a planet transits in Rohini in Lagna; the native makes short travel. But when Mars transits in Hastham, Mars indicates expenses through wife and being the 11th to the 7th, it indicates gains to her, or purchases for her. It is the general predictions it does not happen. But the partner goes on a long journey; has treatment for the disease and gets cured.

Mrigasirasha, Chithrai, (Avittam or) Dhanishia: Mars, lord of 7 and 12 owns these three stars. The astrologer must give the results, signified by the 7th and 12th house to Taurus borns if a planet were to be in any of the above said three stars at birth or during transit. If a Taurus-born has married a talkative partner, then during the periods and sub-periods of the planet occupying Mars star may cause even violence, and separation.

Rahu, who does not own any house, rules over Arudhra, Swathi, and Sathabisha. Ascertain the combination of planets with Rahu, the sign and star where it was at birth in the chart. Those results indicated by lordship of the star and sign where Rahu was, will be experienced by the persons born in Taurus, during the periods and sub-periods of the planets in the constellation of Rahu.

Jupiter, a natural benefic, is the owner of the three stars Punarvasu, Visaka, and Poorattathi. As Jupiter is the lord of 8th and 11th house, you have to read the results of the 8th and 11th house matters if a planet was in these stars at birth or while a planet transits in any of these stars.

Pushyam, Anuradha, and Uthrattathi are governed by Saturn who owns the 9th and 10th house to Taurus natives. If a planet were to be in any of these stars at birth or if a planet transits in any of these three stars, the native will have the results of the 9th and 10th houses; Suppose, Jupiter was in Anuradha. It is in 7th. 7th house does not show overseas and higher education. But these are shown by lord of 9th and 10th. Jupiter, instead of giving troubles as lord of 8th, it causes the most beneficial and agreeable results, and gives higher education and long journey.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, and Revathi are ruled by Mercury owning houses 2nd and 5th to Taurus borns. The native will experience the results signified by these houses, if a planet occupies any of these stars at birth or when a planet moves on in these three stars. Suppose Moon was is Jyeshta. Moon is lord of 3rd. It has nothing to do with children. But if a person has a child in moon sub-period, in Hastham Star, which are we to take: either the sign lord or the star lord or the house it owns or occupies.

### Gemini borns

Kethu owns the stars Aswini, Makam, and Moolam, but it has not been allotted any sign. Find out the star and house where Kethu was at birth, the planets conjoined with it, or the planets aspecting it. If a planet occupies these stars at birth or in transit, offer the predictions signified by the lord of the constellation and the sign where Kethu was.

Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam are ruled by Venus, who is lord of 5 and 12 to Gemini borns. If a planet occupies these stars at birth or in transit, the results of the 5th and 12th houses are to be offered. Even though Bharani is in the 11th sign, which is to give pleasure, profit, and only desirable beneficial results, yet the matters of the 5th and 12th houses are experienced. Mostly Gemini borns go overseas and enjoy life even during the periods of evil planets, because they are in any of the 3 stars.

Krithigai, Uthram, Uthradam are ruled by the Sun, lord of 3, who owns these three stars. If a planet was in any of these three stars at birth or during its transit, the results of the 3rd house are offered to Gemini borns.

Rohini, Hastham, Sravanam are owned by the Moon, a weak luminary, who owns the 2nd house and also these stars. Even though Rohini is in the 4th sign, Sravanam in the 8th sign to Gemini, yet the results signified by the 2nd house are experienced if a planet is in these stars at birth or when it transits in any of them.

Mrigasirasha, Chithrai, Avittam are ruled by Mars, who owns the 6th and 11th houses to Gemini borns. If a planet were to occupy these stars at birth or passes in these stars, the results indicated by these houses 6th and 11th are offered to Gemini borns.

Arudhra, Swathi, Sathayam are owned by Rahu, the Ascending Node. So find out where Rahu was at birth, i.e. the sign and constellation it occupied. Offer the results of the lord of the sign and constellation where Rahu was, if you find any planet is in these stars at birth or during transit and provided the node is not conjoined with or aspected by any planet.

Punarpusam, Visakam, Poorattathi are ruled by the benevolent Jupiter, who is the lord of these 3 stars and owns the 7th and 10th houses to Gemini borns. If a planet occupies any of these stars at birth and passes these stars in transit, it offers the results signified by the 7th and 10th house results. It will prove to be a strong maraka.

To Gemini borns, Jupiter is the Bhadhakasthana adhipathi. If there is no planet in Sagittarius at the time of birth, then Rahu in the constellation of Jupiter is the strongest evil to affect one’s longevity, though it is very beneficial for marriage and business.

Pushyam, Anusham, Uthrattathi are owned by Saturn, the slow-moving planet, who owns the 8th and 9th houses to Gemini borns. If a planet occupies any star at birth or transits these stars, the results of the 8th and 9th house are to be presaged.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, Revathi are ruled by Mercury, lord of 1 and 4, who owns these three stars. The native will enjoy the results signified by these houses if a planet occupies or transits these stars.

### Cancer Borns

Ketu or Dragon's tail govern the stars Aswini, Makam, Moolam. Ascertain which sign and constellation Ketu occupies or transits in the horoscope. The results will be indicated by the lord of the constellation and sign. These will be experienced by Cancer borns if a planet occupies or transits these stars.

Venus owns the stars Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam and also the houses 4 and 11 to Cancer-borns. If a planet occupies any of these stars at birth or in transit, the results signified by the lordship of 4 and 11 house is to be predicted. A person has Moon in Pooradam, born in Cancer Lagna, acquires land in Moon dasa. Neither as lord of 1 nor as the planet in 6, it has anything to do with property. But, if one studies the lord of the constellation, he gets the scientific explanation.

Krithigai, Uthram, Uthradam are allotted to Sun. Sun owns the 2" house. Any planet in these stars at birth or while in transit, the native will enjoy the results of the 2" house.

Rohini, Hastham, Sravanam: Lord of lagna governs these three stars. When a planet was in any of these three stars at birth or while in transit, offer the results signified by the first house to the native.

Mrigasirisha, Chithrai, Avittam: Ruled by Mars, lord of 5 and 10, to Cancer-borns. The astrologer has to predict the results signified by the 5 and 10 houses to the native if he finds any planet in these stars in the horoscope or when it transits, in any of these three stars. Mercury, lord of 3 and 12, was in Mrigasira in Gemini. The native has gained money during Mercury sub period in speculation.

Arudhra, Swathi, Sathabisha: Rahu, the node, has been allotted these three stars. Find out with which planets it was conjoined or aspected by and the sign and constellation in which it was posited at birth. The results indicated by the lord of the constellation where Rahu was, will operate when a planet is in any of these stars. Suppose, Rahu is in the 10" house. A planet in the 12" house in Arudhra gives increase in income during this planet’s sub-period, instead of loss indicated by 12" house.

Punarpusam, Visakam, Poorattathi are governed by the benevolent planet Jupiter who also owns the houses 6 and 9. If a planet occupies any of these stars at birth and transit in any of these, the results signified by the 6 and 9 houses are offered to the native.

Pushyam, Anuradha, Uthrattathi: Saturn the delaying planet owns the houses 7 and 8 and also these three stars. Eventhough these stars are in the houses 1, 5, 9, which are said to be Kona houses which will indicate only good results, yet the persons born in Cancer will have the results signified by the 7 and 8 houses alone, during the periods and sub-periods of planets in these constellations, eventhough they may own good houses. A person having Venus in Pushyam, had untold miseries and worries during Venus sub-period; as lord of 11, Venus caused worry through fourth son. Source is shown by the planet. Worry is indicated by the lord of the constellation.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, Revathi: Mercury is the ruler of these stars. It also owns the 3 and 12" houses to Cancer borns. If a planet passes in these stars, the results indicated by the houses 3 and 12 will be enjoyed. For instance, Revathi is in the 9” sign. But if a planet occupies this star at birth or transits, the native will enjoy the results of the 3 and 12" houses and not the results indicated by the 9" house. (That is why people born in Karkata lagna do not enjoy favourable results during the period of the planets in 5 or 9 as the lord of the constellation in these signs are ruled by either lord of 6 or 8 or 12. But they are fortunate during the period of the planets in the constellation of Mars eventhough the houses may be 3 or 8 or 12).

### Leo Borns

Aswini, Makam, Moolam stars are ruled by Kethu, the Moon's node. As it does not own any sign, note the planets which are conjoined with it or aspect it and also the lord of the constellation in which it is. The results signified by the planet with which it is conjoined or by which it is aspected or lord of the constellation will be experienced by the native if a planet transits through these stars.

Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam are governed by Venus which owns the 3rd and 10th houses to Leo-borns. If a planet occupies any of these stars at birth or transits through these, the results signified by the houses 3rd and 10th will be enjoined.

Krithigai, Uthram, Uthradam: The lord of lagna Sun is the ruler of these stars. So, when a planet is noticed in any of these stars, you can offer the results of the 1st house and not the results of the sign in which it transits. It promises success and speedy recovery from disease.

Rohini, Hastham, Sravanam: The luminary owns these three stars who also owns the 12th sign to Leo-borns. So the results indicated by the 12th house alone will be enjoyed by the native if a planet occupies these stars. For instance, Hastham, is in the second sign to Leo. Instead of enjoying the results indicated by the second house (i.e. increase in income and improvement in status) the querist will experience only the result of 12th house (i.e. loss of money and position. Transfer and changes during the period of the planet in Rohini).

Mrigasirisha, Chithrai, Avittam are allotted to Mars who owns the 4th and 9th house to Simha lagna-borns. The astrologer has to offer the matters signified by the houses 9th and 4th to the native when he notices any planet in any of these stars at birth or while in transit.

Arudhra, Swathi, Sathabisha: Our sages mentioned that Rahu is the owner of these stars which has not been given any sign. Find out in which rasi and constellation Rahu was at birth. The results signified by Rahu will be enjoyed or experienced by the native.

Punarpusam, Visakam, Poorattathi: Even though the beneficial planet Guru is the ruler of these stars, yet the native cannot enjoy any other result when a planet passes on in these three stars except the results indicated by the 5th and 8th houses as Guru is the lord of the 5th and 8th to Leo-borns.

Pushyam, Anuradha, Uthrattathi: Saturn lord of 6th and 7th is the owner of these three stars. If you note any planet in these stars, the results indicated by these 6th and 7th will be experienced by the native.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, Revathi: Mercury, lord of 2nd and 11th, owns these three constellations. So the results signified by the houses 2nd and 11th will be enjoyed by the native when a planet transits in any of these stars. For instance, Revathi is in the 8th sign. Normally, planet in the 8th sign will not produce desirable results to the native. Yet, as Revathi is ruled by Mercury, the native receives even the bad debts, becomes popular in his society and realizes his ambitions during the sub-period of the planet in Revathi stars, as Budha owns the houses 2nd and 11th.

### Virgo Borns

Aswini, Makam, Moolam: Find out where Kethu was at birth, i.e. the constellation, and the sign it occupied, as it does not own any sign. The results signified by that constellation and sign will be enjoyed by the native when a planet transits in any of these three stars.

Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam: Venus, the lord of 2nd and 9th houses, owns these stars. So, when you find a planet in any of these stars, offer the results of the 2nd and 9th houses and not the result of the sign where it is. For instance, Bharani star is in the 8th sign. Normally one will offer the result of the 8th house, when a planet transits Bharani. This goes wrong, as the native will go on long journey, appear for interview, will be selected and have monetary gains, as Venus, the governor of Bharani, is the lord of 2nd and 9th, and promises desirable results.

Krithigai, Uthram, Uthradam: Sun, the strong luminary, rules over these three stars and also the 12th house. If a planet occupies any of these stars in whichever house it may be, yet the results indicated by the 12th house alone will be enjoyed by the native and not the results of the sign where the planet transits.

Rohini, Hastham, Sravanam: These stars are ruled by Lunar (Diana, i.e. Moon). Moon rules the 11th sign to Virgo-borns. If we notice any planet in any of these stars at birth or during transit, the native will realise his/her ambition, be popular, have substantial gains, etc., as the planet is in the constellation of lord of 11th.

Mrigasirsha, Chithrai, Avittam: Mars, lord of 3rd and 8th to Virgo, is the owner of these three stars. If a planet be posited in any of these stars in the horoscope or move through these stars, it offers the results signified by the houses 3rd and 8th. It will be adverse.

Arudhra, Swathi, Sathayam: Caput, otherwise called Rahu, is the governor of these stars. Find out the planets conjoined with Rahu, planets aspecting the sign and stars where Rahu is in the chart at birth. The results denoted by the lordship of the star and sign Rahu occupied will be experienced by the native.

Punarpusam, Visakam, Poorattathi: Guru is the chief governor of these stars. It also rules over the 4th and 7th houses to Virgo-borns. If a planet is noticed in any of these stars at birth or while transit, the native will enjoy the results of the 4th and 7th houses. Example: Visakam star is in the 2nd house. If a planet goes through it, the native can enjoy the result signified by the 4th and 7th house only and much less the results of the 2nd house.

Pushyam, Anuradha, Uthratiathi: Saturn rules over these three stars, who also happens to be lord of 5th and 6th. If you find any planet either at birth or during transit, in any of these stars, predict the results signified by the 5th and 6th houses.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, Revathi: Lord of 1st and 10th Mercury is the owner of these stars. Planets in any of these three stars in whichever sign it may be, will offer the results indicated by the 1st and 10th houses to the native. It is very good.

### Libra Borns

Aswini, Makam, Moolam, which are governed by Cauda (otherwise known as Kethu), do not own any sign in the Zodiac. Ascertain in which constellation and sign Kethu is in the chart. The results indicated by the lord of the constellation where Kethu was will be experienced by the native.

Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam: Venus, lord of 1 and 8, rules over these stars. If you find any planet in any of these stars, you have to predict the results indicated by the 1st and 8th houses only. For instance, Pooram is in the 11th sign to Libra. If a planet transits in that star, the general principle of saying a planet in 11th will do only good will not operate, but the native will enjoy the results of the 1st and 8th houses only. He will fall ill, face danger and fail.

Krithigai, Uthradam, Uthram: Sun is the owner of these stars, which also owns the 11th sign. Any planet in any of these three stars in the horoscope will produce the result of the 11th house, i.e. profit, pleasure, realization of ambition, etc., even though the stars fall in any sign. For example, Krithigai in the 8th sign, Uthram in the 12th house does not offer the result of that sign but assures the results of the 11th house only.

Rohini, Hastham, Sravanam: Moon, the other luminary, is allotted these stars, which owns the 10th house to Libra. Any planet in these stars produce the result of the 10th house and not the sign where it is at birth or while in transit.

Mrigasirisha, Chitrai, Avittam: Mars is lord of 2 and 7 and also the owner of these stars. A planet in these stars in the chart given by the native will bring out the results indicated by the houses 2 and 7 and does not produce the results of the sign in which it is or it transits.

Ascending Node (Rahu) rules over the three stars Arudhra, Swathi, Sathayam. As our sages have not offered any sign to Rahu, find out in which sign and constellation Rahu was at birth. The results signified by these constellations and sign will be offered to the native if any planet passes through these stars.

Punarpusam, Visakam, Poorattathi: Stars are ruled by Guru, who owns houses 3 and 6 to Libra-borns. If a planet is in any of these stars at birth or transit through stars, you have to predict the results indicated by the 3rd and 6th houses only.

Pushyam, Anuradha, Uthrattathi: Stars are allotted to Saturn, the only benefic to Libra-borns, as it rules over the 4th and 5th houses. Planets in the stars ruled by Saturn will offer the results signified by the 4th and 5th houses and not the results of the sign where it transits.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, Revathi: Budha, the wavering planet, governs over these three stars and also the houses 9 and 12 to Libra-borns. You will find that these stars fall in the 2nd, 6th and 10th signs, but the native will experience the results of the 9th and 12th houses only.

### Scorpio-borns

Aswini, Makam, Moolam: As the descending node (Kethu) does not own any sign but rules only these stars in the Zodiac, find out the planets that are conjoined with Kethu, aspecting Kethu and constellation and sign where it was at birth. The results signified by the lord of the constellation and sign will be enjoyed by the native, in whichever sign the stars may be.

Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam: These are governed by Venus who owns the 7th and 12th houses to Scorpio-borns. If a planet is noticed in any of these stars at birth or during transit, it will offer the results of the 7th and 12th houses. For instance, Pooradam is in the 2nd sign to Scorpio. Generally, while a planet moves on in his star you will predict the results indicated by the 2nd house only, i.e., free flow of cash, increase in the members of the family, peaceful atmosphere at home, but the native will have secret inimical activities, ill-health to partner in life or business, as Venus happens to be lord of 7th and 12th to the native and lord of 1st and 6th to the 7th house which indicated wife or partner in business also death in a foreign place. 7th house shows death to the native, 12th house indicates far off place, separation from family members.

Krithigai, Uthram, Uthradam are allotted to Sun, the strongest planet which rules the 10th house also to Vrishchika-borns. Any planet in the star ruled by Sun at birth or during transit will produce the results of the 10th house.

Rohini, Hastham, Sravanam are governed by Moon the Queen of Night. It rules the house 9th to this rasi-born. The astrologer has to offer the results which will be produced by the 9th house to the native and not the sign in which the stars are posited.

Mrigasirisha, Chithrai, Avittam are ruled by the lord of 1st and 6th, Mars. Planets in these stars produce the results of the houses 1st and 6th.

Arudhra, Swathi, Sathayam: Our sages did not allot any sign to Rahu. But it governs these stars. Rahu produces the results indicated by the lordship of the constellation and sign where it is at birth or during transit. Planets in these stars give the results indicated by Rahu.

Punarpusam, Visakam, Poorattathi are ruled by Jupiter who owns the 2nd and 5th houses to Scorpio. Even though Punarpusam and Visakam are in the 8th and 12th Signs, yet the results enjoyed by the native will be the results allotted to the 2nd and 5th houses by ancient astrologers, when a planet passes through these stars.

Pushyam, Anuradha, Uthrattathi are governed by Saturn. Houses 3rd and 4th also are governed by the same planet, Saturn. So when a planet occupies the star ruled by Saturn either at birth or during transit, it will produce the results of the 3rd and 4th houses.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, Revathi: Mercury is the ruler of these three stars and owns the 8th and 11th houses to Scorpio-borns. If you find a planet in the stars ruled by Mercury, you have to portend the results indicated by the 8th and 11th house to the native forgetting the sign in which it is. It is very bad in the ascendant.

### Sagittarius - Born

Aswini, Makam, and Moolam were given to Dragon's Tail (Kethu) by our ancients, but they did not allot any sign to it then. Find out the sign and constellation where Kethu was at the time of birth or during transit. The results of the lordship of the star and sign where Kethu was will operate if a planet is in Aswini, Makam, or Moolam.

Bharani, Pooram, and Pooradam: These stars are ruled by Venus, which rules the 6th and 11th houses to Dhanur-borns. If a planet occupies any of these three stars at birth or transit through these, then the results indicated by the 6th and 11th houses will be enjoyed by the native.

Krithigai, Uthram, and Uthradam are governed by the Sun, the ruler of the 9th house to Sagittarius. Results produced by the 9th house will be enjoyed by the native, if a planet is in any of the stars.

Rohini, Hastham, and Sravanam are allotted to the Moon, who is the owner of the 8th house. Planets in these stars at birth or while in transit will produce the results indicated by the 8th house and not the sign where the planet is. For example, Sravanam is in the 2nd house. When a planet moves on in it, the result of the 24th house will not be experienced, but the result of the 8th house alone will operate. Hastham brings ill repute.

Mrigasiasha, Chithrai, and Avittam are allotted to Mars. Mars rules over the 5th and 12th houses to this rasi-born. In whichever sign these stars may be, yet the result of the 5th and 12th houses alone will be enjoyed. For instance, Chithrai in the 11th sign will make the native spend for his children, invest money, and have worry due to inimical activities, but the 11th sign shows all-round success and popularity, peace of mind. Hence, the lordship of the constellation alone should be taken into consideration while predicting.

Arudhra, Swathi, and Sathabisha: The results signified by the constellation and sign lords where Rahu was at birth or is during transit will be enjoyed by the native, if a planet transits through the stars ruled by Rahu.

Punarpushyam, Visakam, and Uthrattathi: Stars are governed by the benefic Jupiter, who happens to be the lord of lagna and also lord of 4. The results allotted to the houses 1 and 4 will be experienced by the native if a planet transits or occupies these three stars.

Pushyam, Anuradha, and Uthrattathi; Saturn rules these three stars. Saturn owns the 2nd and 3rd houses to Sagittarius-borns. So, the results of the 2nd and 3rd houses will be enjoyed by the querist during the period when a planet moves on in the stars governed by Saturn.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, and Revathi are governed by Mercury, who owns the houses 7 and 10 to Dhanur rasi-borns. Results indicated by the 7th and 10th houses will be enjoyed by the person if a planet occupies these stars at birth or during transit and not the results indicated by the sign it occupies where these stars are posited. Planets in Jyesta give promotion, transfer, and position. It also indicates severing connection with one institution and accepting a better job in another institution.

### Capricorn - Borns

Aswini, Makam, and Moolam are governed by the descending node Kethu. Find out the lord of the constellation and sign which Kethu occupies. What Kethu promises to do, will be done by the planet which occupies its star or which transits in any of the three stars.

Bharani, Pooram, and Pooradam stars are ruled by Venus which owns the 5th and 10th houses also. If a planet occupies any of these stars at birth or transits through these stars, results indicated by the 5th and 10th houses will operate. For example, Pooram falls in the 8th sign to Makaram. When Moon transits in that star (Chandraastama day) the native will receive money and be happy.

But, general prediction of the astrologers that the native cannot have any beneficial results and cannot have peace of mind during Chandraastama days will fail.

Krithigai, Uthram, and Uthradam stars are governed by Sun who is the lord of the 8th House. So, when a planet occupies any of these stars the native cannot have desirable results but unnecessary impediment and worries in his attempts may be experienced.

Rohini, Hastham, and Sravanam stars are ruled by the lord of 7th, Moon. If a planet occupies any of these stars at birth the native should be offered the results of the 7th house and not the matters signified by the house or sign.

Mrigasirisha, Chithrai, and Avittam; Mars governs over these three stars. It also owns the houses 4th and 11th to Makara borns. If you find any planet occupying any of these stars, then the native will have the results signified by the lordship of the 4th and 11th houses.

Arudhra, Swathi, and Sathayam: Ascertain the strength of Rahu by noting the constellation and sign which it occupied. The results indicated by the lord of the constellation will operate whenever a planet moves on, in the stars ruled by Rahu, the Dragon's head.

Punarpusam, Visakam, and Poorattathi: Jupiter rules the houses 3rd and 12th and also these three stars. Whenever a planet occupies any of these stars or transits through these, then the native will have results of the 3rd and 12th houses.

Pushyam, Anuradha, and Uthrattathi stars governed by Saturn also rules the 1st and 2nd houses to Makaram borns. If the astrologer finds planets in these stars, he has to offer the results indicated to the lordship of the 1st and 2nd houses to the native.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, and Revathi: Mercury is given these stars and also houses 6th and 9th. Planets in the stars of Mercury give the results of the 6th and 9th houses. For example, Jyesta is in the 11th Sign. If a planet moves on in this star instead of enjoying the results indicated by the 11th house, the native will have the results of the 6th and 9th more prominently.

### Aquarius-borns

- Ashwini, Makam, Moolam stars are governed by Kethu, who does not own any sign in the Zodiac. Find out in which constellation and sign Kethu is. Judge what Kethu can do; that will be given by the planet in any of the three stars.
- Bharani, Pooram, Pooradam: Venus governs over these stars, which also rules over the 4th and 9th houses. When a planet occupies any of these stars at birth or during the transit, the native should be offered the results indicated by the 4th and 9th houses only.
- Krithigai, Uthram, Uthradam stars are allotted to Sun. 7th house results will be experienced by the native if a planet moves on the constellations ruled by Sun, as Sun happens to be the lord of 7th. Uthram in the 8th sign, Uthradam in the 12th sign do not offer the results of the 8th or 12th house but give only the 7th house results.
- Rohini, Hastham, Sravanam: Moon, the other luminary, governs over these stars which owns only the 6th sign to Kumbha-borns. Hence, the results signified by the 6th house has to be predicted to the native if a planet moves on through these three stars.
- Mrigasirisha, Chithrai, Avittam: Mars, the governor of these stars, rules the 3rd and 10th houses to the Aquarius-borns. So, when a planet is seen in any of these stars, you portend the results allotted to the 3rd and 10th houses to the native.
- Arudhra, Swathi, Sathabisha: Rahu, the Moon’s North Node, rules over these asterisms. Find out the strength of Rahu by its occupation of the star and Rasi where it was at birth. The results due to lordship of the constellation and sign where Rahu was, will operate when a planet transits in Arudhra, Swathi, Sathabisha.
- Punarpusam, Visaka, Poorattathi are ruled by the benevolent planet Jupiter, who also owns the 2nd and 11th houses. So, the results indicated by the 2nd and 11th houses will be enjoyed by the person if a planet moves on in the stars of Guru, in whatever sign it may be.
- Pushyam, Anuradha, Uthrattathi: Saturn, lord of 1st and 12th, happens to own these stars. Results denoted by the 1st and 12th house will operate if a planet occupies at birth or transits in the three stars governed by Saturn.
- Ashlesha, Jyesta, Revathi: Mercury, lord of 5th and 8th, rules over these stars. Results of the 5th and 8th houses also should be predicted to the native if a planet passes through them. For example, Revathi is in the 2nd house. General prediction of the results if a planet transits in the 2nd house will do good to native does not operate but the results of 5th and 8th, i.e. mixed ones will be experienced, when a planet moves on in Revathi.

### Pisces-borns

Aswini, Makam, and Moolam are ruled by the descending Node. Kethu, who does not own any house in the Zodiac, has to be ascertained by its occupation in the constellation. The results denoted by the lord of the constellation and sign where Kethu was at the time of birth will predominate.

Bharani, Pooram, and Pooradam are ruled by Venus, who also happens to be the owner of the 3rd and 8th houses to Pisces-borns. Results signified by the houses 3 and 8 will operate if a planet occupies the constellation of Venus when we consider the horoscope.

Krithigai, Uthram, and Uthradam are governed by the lord of the 6th. Sun, the strong luminary, has to offer the results of the 6th house while predicting if he finds any planet in the stars owned by Sun, at birth or while it transits.

Rohini, Hastham, and Sravanam are owned by Moon, the night queen, who also governs the 5th sign. So portend the results allotted to the 5th house when a planet passes through the constellation of Moon. For instance, Rohini is in the 3rd sign to Pisces. When practically seen during the period of the planet in Rohini, the native enjoys the results of the 5th house and not the results indicated by the 3rd house.

Mrigasirisha, Chithrai, and Avittam are governed by Mars, lord of the 2nd and 9th to this rasi-borns. Matters signified by the 2nd and 9th houses alone will be enjoyed by the querist while a planet moves on in the stars owned by Mars, in whichever sign it may be.

Arudhra, Swathi, and Sathabisha are governed by Rahu, who does not own any sign. Ascertain in which constellation and sign Rahu is. The results indicated by the constellation and sign where Rahu is will operate if a planet would have occupied that star during its period.

Punarpusam, Visakam, and Poorattathi are governed by the lord of the 1st and 10th. The results indicated by the houses 1 and 10 will operate during the period of the planets that has occupied the stars governed by Jupiter either at birth or when in transit. For example, Visaka is in the 8th sign and Poorattathi is in the 12th sign. If you notice any planet in these stars, general prediction of the 8th and 12th houses where the planet will fail but the results of 1 and 10 will operate.

Pushyam, Anuradha, and Uthrattathi are allotted these three stars to Saturn, who also was given the 11th and 12th houses to Pisces. If a planet were to occupy any of these stars, either at birth or during transit, it will produce the results of the 11th and 12th houses only and not the results of the houses in which it is.

Ashlesha, Jyesta, and Revathi are governed by Mercury. Mercury owns the 4th and 7th houses to Pisces. Hence, results of the 4th and 7th houses alone should be declared when you find a planet in the constellation of Ashlesha, Jyesta, and Revathi either in the horoscope made for the time of birth or during transit.

Always judge who is the Lord of the constellation and note to the native what it can offer. Those results indicated by the lord of the constellation will be enjoyed during the period of the planet in that constellation and whenever a planet transits in that star, through the source indicated by the planet in the star.
