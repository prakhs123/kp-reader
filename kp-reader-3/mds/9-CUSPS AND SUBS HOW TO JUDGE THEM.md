They will have honour, awards, and prestige, and rise to a high social and professional position with no indignity or dishonour. They will have high ambitions and be very auspicious for business and to be a statesman.

They will have a liking for studying occult science and practising yoga, and prefer to go to unfrequented places. Even for minor ailments, hospitalisation is possible, and there is the danger of imprisonment. They will be the cause of their own undoing, and be a victim of being cheated and swindled. They should guard against treachery and conspiracy, and prefer to invest money rather than keep it in a bank.

If the sub lord of the 2nd cusp is the significator of 1 and 2, the native will find it easy to make money by their own efforts, and they will serve or do business and try to increase their bank position. If the sub-lord of 2 is the significator of the houses 1, 2 and 6, they will enter into service, or if the significator of the 2nd cusp is the significator of the houses 1, 7 and 10, they will do business. If the sub-lord is the significator of 1, 2 and 12 and is connected with the Sun, Moon or Venus, they will lose their vision. If connected with Saturn, they will suffer from toothache. If Saturn and Moon are connected, their mouth will be foul smelling and they will have pyorrhoea.

If the sub-lord of the second cusp is the significator of the second and the third, they can gain through education, writing, publicity, publication, journalism, brothers, colleagues, neighbours and by taking up agencies, commission business, touring, salesmanship, representation and short tours. However, there will be loss to younger brothers. This sub-lord will be very lucky for their children.

If the sub-lord of the second cusp is the significator of the second and the fourth house, they will gain estates and money as inheritance, and be anxious to own buildings, houses, land, mines, etc. They will be successful in their own place and have a permanent place of residence, as well as automobiles and transport.

If the sub-lord of the second cusp is the significator of 2nd and 5th houses, they will gain through music, opera, cinema, pleasant amusement, sport, entertainment, younger people and children. This planet will prove to be very lucky for their children and mother.
If the sub-lord of the second cusp is the significator of the houses 2 and 6, one makes profit in any transaction. One can have enough of overdraft facilities, come out successful in the election and gain. One can deal with pet animals, poultry, public health departments, medicine, all humanitarian service, gains through labour and labour department. This is also very good for one's children.

If the sub-lord of 2nd cusp is the significator of 2 and 7, one gains through partner in business or by marriage, one makes good profit in contract business and in any manner dealing with others, and success in litigation. One retains seniority, enemies meet with danger, and it is slightly good for children.

If the sub-lord of the second is the significator of the houses 2 and 8, one can gain by legacy, insurance bonus, gratuity or by will. If the same planet is the significator of the 9th house, one loses money due to bank failure. But if this is the significator of 11, gain is a certainty. Children make fortune in their own place and possess property.

If the sub-lord of 2 is the significator of 2 and 9, one makes money by export and import, by publication of books, by making long journeys, by contacting foreigners, or by discovering some improvements and by patenting the same. One gains through religion, temples, churches, science, relatives of partner, etc. Speculative gains to children.

If sub-lord of the 2nd cusp is the significator of the second and the tenth house, one makes steady progress, ever prosperous, gets into government service, or undertaking any business, has honours, awards, increase in reputation, success in all undertakings. Children get into service or come out successful in competitive examination or election or litigation.

If the sub-lord of the second cusp is the significator of the houses 2 and 11, one makes money without much effort, gains without pains, through speculation; friends oblige. There will be accidental fortune like lottery where the investment is the minimum and the gain is substantial. Equally it is lucky for children to gain by business or win in litigation.

If the sub-lord of the second cusp is the significator of 2 and 12, one can make money by serving in a sanatorium, asylum, hospital, occult investigations, circus, jails, etc.; not good for children. 

Thus one is to find out to which house a planet is the significator and calmly judge what it can do.
