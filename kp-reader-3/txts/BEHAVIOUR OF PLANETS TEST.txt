If a planet, say Mars, is in Hastham, and the Lagna of the person is Scorpio and Moon occupies 11th house, Virgo, one has to consider as follows:
Moon is lord of 9: Moon is in 11: The latter is more predominant. So, the planet that is situated in Hastham (or 
 Rohini or Sravanam) offers the matters signified by 11th House bhava more predominantly than the matters indicated by 9th house. These matters are fulfilled through Mars, lord of 1 and 6. 
 The source of fulfillment or accomplishment is Mars, according to its nature, occupation and ownership. The result is given by 
 Moon when Moon's period or Sub period runs.
