## Twelve Signs of the Zodiac - Their Classification and Their Influence
The circle of space surrounding the Earth and measuring 360 degrees of celestial longitude is referred to as the Zodiac. It is an imaginary belt in the Heavens, 15 degrees wide in which the planets travel. It is the path in the middle of which the Sun appears to move around the Earth, called the Ecliptic.

The Zodiac is divided into 12 equal parts. They are: 1. Aries - Mesha, 2. Taurus - Rishaba, 3. Gemini - Mithuna, 4. Cancer - Kataka, 5. Leo - Simha, 6. Virgo - Kanni, 7. Libra - Thulam, 8. Scorpio - Vrischika, 9. Sagittarius - Dhanus, 10. Capricorn - Makara, 11. Aquarius - Kumba, 12. Pisces - Meena. Each of these is a solar mansion, otherwise called a sign or a rasi, and each extends to exactly 30 degrees. Each sign has derived its name from its resemblance to the group of constellations found in and around the Zodiac.

These signs may be classified broadly into thirteen groups depending on their influences on animate and inanimate objects. They are: (1) Positive and Negative Signs, (2) Northern and Southern Equinoctial, Tropical Signs, (3) Fiery, Earthy, Airy and Watery Signs, (4) Movable, Fixed and Common Signs, (5) Fruitful or Barren Signs, (6) Mute Signs, (7) Violent Signs, (8) Human Signs, (9) Voice Signs, (10) Bestial or Four-Legged Signs, (11) Dual Signs, (12) Bicorporal or Double-Bodied Signs, and (13) Short and Long Ascension Signs.

### Positive and Negative Signs
The signs from Aries (Mesha) onwards are alternatively positive and negative. They are sometimes referred to as masculine (or day signs) and feminine (or night signs) respectively. Thus, the odd signs namely, Aries (Mesha), Gemini (Mithuna), Leo (Simha), Libra (Thulam), Sagittarius (Dhanus) and Aquarius (Kumba) are positive (or masculine); the even signs viz., Taurus (Rishabha), Cancer (Kataka), Virgo (Kanya), Scorpio (Vrischika), Capricorn (Makara) and Pisces (Meena) are negative (or feminine).

The positive signs denote an assertive, bold, expressive, active and offensive nature. They give determination, power of will and force. On the other hand, the negative signs show a passive, receptive, defensive and a somewhat conciliatory disposition. There is a tendency for the positive signs to be more self-expressive and less passive in their reactions and for the negative signs to be more self-repressive and less outgoing and spontaneous.

A positive sign as Ascendant indicates that the native is more generally fortunate in their undertakings than a negative sign does. The negative signs are weak and feminine on account of passive qualities. If the lagna falls in a male sign and other testimonies also support, then even a lady born in a modest family will have masculine appearance and qualities. But if the lagna falls in a male sign occupied by feminine planets or if the lord of lagna occupies a female sign, they may be a male with feminine qualities, appearance and character, etc.

If the sign on the cusp of the 5th house falls in a masculine sign; if the 5th lord is a masculine planet and is in a masculine sign, etc., most of the offspring will be boys. If these happen to be feminine, then the offspring will be girls. This is a general rule. Positive signs on the cusp of the ascendant give vitality, negative signs are not so vigorous, unless a strong masculine planet is very near the cusp of the Ascendant.

### Northern and Southern Signs
The first six signs of the Zodiac, namely, Mesha, Rishaba, Mithuna, Kataka, Simha, and Kanya (i.e., Aries to Virgo) are called Northern signs, as they are to the north of the celestial Equator (they are in the northern hemisphere). The remaining six signs, that is, Thulam, Vrischikam, Dhanus, Makara, Kumba, and Meena (Libra to Pisces) are to the south of the celestial Equator (in the southern hemisphere) and are so termed southern signs.

### Equinoctial Signs
Equinox means equal day and night. When the Sun is in the intersecting point of the celestial Equator and the Ecliptic, where Aries commences and Pisces ends, and the point of intersection is at the end of Virgo and the beginning of Libra, then the days and nights are equal all over the world. This phenomenon occurs only twice a year, around 21st March and 23rd September. Mesha (Aries) and Thulam (Libra) are hence the two equinoctial signs. Mesha (Aries) is the vernal equinoctial sign and Thulam (Libra) the autumnal equinoctial sign.

### Tropical Signs
Cancer (Kataka) and Capricorn (Makara) are the two tropical signs. They are sometimes referred to as the summer solstitial sign and winter solstitial sign, respectively. The days are the longest when the Sun is in the initial point of Cancer, and the nights are the longest when the Sun is in the beginning of Capricorn. According to the Sayana system, the Sun enters Capricorn on or around the 22nd of December every year. However, the dates are different according to the Nirayana system, which uses a fixed zodiac.

### The Zodiacal Signs and Their Corresponding Elements
The zodiacal signs are classified into four groups or triplicities according to the four elements: fire, earth, air, and water. These elements symbolize spiritual, physical, mental, and psychic processes in humans. The four groups are as follows:

Fire: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius
Earth: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn
Air: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius
Water: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces

### Fiery Signs
The fiery signs represent the vital spirit, including activity. They tend to an assertive, independent, courageous, and enthusiastic nature. They signify activity and ambition, vigour and vitality, energy and push. When fiery signs are on the cusp of the ascendant, the disposition is said to be proud, enterprising, and commanding, with more desire to lead than to serve. The native may be argumentative and self-confident, with an aspiring, acute, and penetrating mind. They will not relish the suggestions offered by others and will act on their own impulses. A spiritual bent of mind is also denoted.

Fiery signs as Ascendant cause fevers and inflammatory disorders, usually acute but lasting only for a short duration. According to Westerners, if the majority of planets occupy fiery signs, it shows ingenuity, force, and energy, and fits the native to study mechanics and to follow any trade or profession in which metals and fire play a part, such as those of soldiers, mechanics, engineers, smiths, barbers, butchers, surgeons, and other hazardous and dangerous vocations. Planets in these signs are more active than in others.

Leo has stated that fiery signs are connected with vitality and vital force; earthy signs with the physical body; airy signs with the nervous system, brain, and mind generally; and watery signs with the etheric double - the finer mould into which the physical system was cast at birth.

### Earthy Signs
Earthy signs show solidity and stability, indicating material welfare and a tendency to seek power and position. If rising, they also give good health. People with a majority of planets in earthy signs tend to be careful and cautious, premeditative, prudent, practical, secretive, suspicious, stubborn, self-protective, slow and steady, reserved, restrained, methodical, economical, plodding, and persevering. Their minds are practical, objective, scientific, methodical, and materialistic.

Business is often the best option for those with a majority of planets in earthy signs. According to Mr. L. George, these signs are associated with a nervous temperament, restlessness, worry, and agitation, as well as a predisposition to rheumatic and windy complaints and chronic disorders.

Earthy signs may lead to occupations connected with agriculture, horticulture, gardening, land, mines, timber, building materials, contracting, foodstuffs (raw and cooked), grocery business, restaurants, grain dealing, dress goods, and clothing.

### Airy Signs
Airy signs are distinctly connected with mental and mental experiences. If well connected, they indicate less vitality, but show cheerful, gentle, amiable, courteous, sympathetic, refined, and human nature. They offer good intellect, a fertile imagination, and an idealistic and artistic nature. People born in airy signs will be well-informed and wide-awake workers, with active circulation and plump bodies.

Professions that require more mental and brain activity than physical activity are best suited for people born in airy signs. These include accountants, bookkeepers, poets, novelists, lawyers, artists, reporters, lecturers, scientists, aviators, inventors, etc. The majority of planets in airy signs show that the native is talented, refined, courteous, idealistic, and often inconstant. They will be artistic and literary-minded. However, due to overwork, they may suffer from nervous troubles.

### Watery Signs Signify Fertile Imagination

Watery signs signify a fruitful nature and give enough of fertile imagination. They show less recuperative power and the constitution will be weak. The disposition is timid, inert, and unwilling to act. The mind is receptive, contemplative, sensitive, sentimental, and psychic. Occult tendencies are indicated.

Alan Leo says as follows: "The watery signs are the least fortunate, giving sensitiveness and often lack of energy. When the majority of the planets occupy watery signs, the native is shy, sensitive, timid, psychic and often lacks energy. The watery signs, if afflicted, make one anaemic and weak pulsed. In later stages, tumour or cancerous growths may trouble them. Watery signs, if rising, give much less stamina and predispose to digestive, urinary and catarrh troubles.

Watery signs favour all employments in which liquid is used, including mineral water, wines and spirits, washing clothes, sailing, emotional acting, elocution, soft goods, textiles, fabrics, chemists, and more. A majority of planets in watery signs denotes a psychic or emotional nature; the instinctive consciousness is very keen; the native is more or less receptive or impressionable; often mediumistic and sometimes passionate.

### The Qualities of Movable, Fixed, and Common Signs
Each category of the four signs (such as movable, fixed, and common) has a common factor or quality of expression, but this quality in each sign is applied differently. The three qualities may be compared to the three Gunas of Hindus, viz., the cardinal or movable to Rajas (activity), the fixed to Tamas (constancy), and the mutable or common to Sattva (rhythm). Mesha, Kataka, Thulam, and Makara are movable signs; Rishaba, Simha, Vrischika, and Kumbha are fixed ones; and Mithuna, Kanya, Dhanus, and Meena are common signs.

### Movable Signs
Movable signs represent movement from one place to another, just as water in the river flows smoothly without going back to its source. They show enterprise, enthusiasm, love of ambition, forcefulness, and go-ahead spirit; fame recognition and popularity; and ability to complete plans and execute them in a short time. The native always loves change and reform. They represent the busy people, the best businessmen, pioneers, those who rise in life on their own and those who make headway against heavy odds and impediments. The natives of movable signs are independent in spirit and self-assertive. They dislike dependence on others and are averse to subordination.

Movable signs on the Ascendant incline to ailments affecting the head, stomach, kidneys and all movable or functional disorders. They tend to brain fever, headache, fits, disorders of the stomach, kidney troubles, cold, rheumatism, injuries to the head and knees, etc. Afflictions from movable signs indicate acute ailments which usually run their course and leave no particular trace.

Movable signs on the cusp of the 2nd house help one to earn money through name, fame and public recognition. The natives of these signs have great vitality and dynamism so much so that they gain through activity, ambition and adventures. There is the liability to fluctuating fortune and changes where money is concerned. Speculative enterprise is favoured and acquisitiveness is usually well developed.

If the third house cusp falls in a movable sign, it signifies that the mind is often aspiring, active, ambitious, enterprising but changeable. One will love change and like travels. He will do a lot of traveling about. Close ties with cousins, neighbours, etc., and with relatives in general are developed. Being possessed of dynamic energy, one will be able to take up pioneer work. The natives of these signs are ardent in whatever they undertake and if they once espouse a cause—social, political, religious or educational or any other—they will work for that cause with all the vim and vigor of their energetic nature. They succeed through sheer audacity.

The persons influenced by these signs are best fitted in positions that require speed and swiftness, wit and ingenuity and tact and diplomacy. They never rest content until they are in the lead of whatever pursuit they follow. They scorn subordination. These natives are ideally suited to occupy responsible and authoritative positions.

When, in a horoscope, the majority of the planets are placed in movable signs or when these signs are on the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses called angles or kendras, it shows that one will hold a prominent position, be it trade, business, politics or profession. He will exhibit ambition and enterprise to a great degree. They will never feel fully satisfied unless they are at the head of things. They are fond of changes in life and will have many changes too.

If Jupiter occupies the 11th house falling in a movable sign, it indicates executive ability and progress; if this happens to be a fixed sign, jealousy and pride among friends is the result; if it is a common sign, one may have friends who are scientifically inclined or religious minded. Also, one's friends may prove unreliable. Saturn placed in the 11th house in a fixed sign signifies that there will be delay and hindrance through friends. If the 11th cusp is in a common sign and Saturn is also there, one may not achieve one's hopes. There may also be sorrow through friends.

When the movable signs are on the angles (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses) one will be resourceful and alert. He would grasp an idea very quickly. Being enterprising and active, he will shun no effort in order to succeed. He will succeed in any enterprise, come what may. A brave, bold and indomitable spirit is indicated.

### Fixed Signs
The influence of the fixed signs rouses the desire nature, giving stamina and persistence in action. People of these signs have a very strong and determined will. They are pre-eminently thorough. If they make up their mind to do something, they will keep on working with remarkable patience and persistence until success comes to them. They are very practical in their approach. They will not mind doing anything for one who has won their affection. They are very firm in their mental attitude and once an opinion has been formed, they cling to it with tenacity. They are very difficult people to convince, but when once won over to a cause, they will defend it to the last.

Those influenced by the fixed signs will be outspoken, self-reliant, and reliable, and remarkably patient. On the other side, they are obstinate, rigid, dogmatic, unrelenting, and unbending. They will persist in a given direction and neither reason nor argument will turn them. Their tendency is to seek solitude and become self-absorbed. These people are endowed with good executive ability. The natives with the fixed sign are very fond of comfort, luxury, and other refining influences of life.

Fixed signs tend to ailments affecting the heart and the generative system. Chronic or organic troubles are threatened. One may suffer from diseases like diphtheria, bronchitis, asthma, heart troubles, defective circulation, and spinal complaints. Afflictions from fixed signs denote that one may inherit hereditary diseases which usually become chronic.

Fixed signs bring the native gain through authoritative influence, investments, and accumulation of unearned income. There being no fluctuation denoted, one can expect to have a fixed income. If the third house falls in a fixed sign, then the native will have a fixed and rigid attitude. He will be persevering, plodding, painstaking, proud, and authoritative. He dislikes traveling; any travel is usually forced by circumstances. It favors government service and employment in ancient institutions and established businesses with security of service. One will achieve success through slow, steady, and sustained effort.

The fixed sign people grasp opportunities slowly. Being conservative-minded, they do not quickly respond to the new environment and care more for permanency and fixity. When fixed signs are on the cusps of the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th houses in a horoscope, or most of the planets are found in fixed signs, one will be firm, determined, dignified, and self-reliant. He will be slow and plodding but will succeed eventually. One will require time to come to a decision. "Patient persistence in every doing" is his motto. He is sure to rise in life through fixity of purpose and persistent effort. He will put his talent to the best use. Setbacks do not daunt him. He will adhere to a method only after being satisfied that it will meet his requirements. It is next to impossible to change him, but when veered round to a cause, he will prove to be its most ardent and reliable advocate.

### Common Signs: Characteristics and Effects
Common signs, which are dual and mutable, may be likened to a swinging pendulum. They represent the vibratory motion passing from one point to another and back again, linking the two extremes of its motion. Flexibility or plasticity is the predominant characteristic of these signs. People born in these signs or having a majority of the planets in these signs will often be inconstant, indecisive, vacillating, and restless. They are peaceful and sympathetic in their disposition and cordial and pleasing in their manner. They are averse to exerting their will power and often drift and dream of the future.

People with common signs are sensitive to and much swayed by their surrounding environment, as they lack the stamina to assert themselves. They are not capable of the slow and sustained work put forth by the fixed class, and get easily discouraged by difficulties. They are best suited to take up agencies, commission jobs, etc., in which much executive skill is not required. These signs bring income to one through service and ordinary means, but finance is prone to fluctuation. People of common signs are not capable of accumulating wealth, as they are lazy and indifferent.

Common signs incline to affections of the lungs, limbs, breathing apparatus, and all kinds of nervous disorders. These diseases are often convertible, and one may be able to overcome them entirely or they may become chronic depending on the individual's mental temperament. When common signs are connected with houses 2, 6, and 10, one is best fitted to serve others. When common signs are on the cusps of the angles (1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th houses in the chart) or when a number of planets are posited in these signs, the mind is often fickle, lightly superficial, wavering, and versatile. One may grasp an idea in a short time and arrive at a decision, but will change their decision quickly. They will succeed in life by other's aid, but not gain the required recognition for their merit and labour. If the 1st and 7th lords are in harmonious aspect or in parivartana (mutual exchange), partnership is advisable; a good mutual working arrangement is indicated. If the cusp of the 11th house and the lord of 11 is in common signs, one will acquire doubtful friendships.

### Fruitful Signs
Cancer (Kataka), Scorpio (Vrischika), and Pisces (Meena) are said to be fruitful in nature, with all watery signs being fruitful. Taurus (Rishaba), Libra (Thulam), Capricorn (Makara), and Sagittarius (Dhanus) are said to be semi-fruitful. Fruitful signs in the cusps of the 5th and 7th houses and their lords in fruitful signs indicate an early union. Barren signs in the cusps of the 5th and 1st houses indicate that the native is not likely to marry in time (provided other testimonies also point to the same view). Fruitful signs covering the 11th and 5th houses and the lords of 5 and 11 in fruitful signs promise progeny. Barren signs in the cusps of the 1st, 5th, and 11th or the lords of these in barren signs lessen chances of children.

### Barren Signs
Aries (Mesha), Gemini (Mithuna), Leo (Simha), and Virgo (Kanya) are called barren or sterile signs. These are not fruitful. Barren signs on the cusps of the 5th and 11th house (11th house being 5th to the partner), the lords of these not fruitful signs, Moon not in a fruitful sign, the lagna not a fruitful sign, the lord of lagna not occupying a fruitful sign, and no fruitful planet in the 5th or 11th houses are indications of no children.

### Mute Signs
All watery signs (namely, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces) are mute signs. If Mercury, being the lord of the 6th house, is in the 2nd house in a mute sign or the lord of the 6th house is in the 2nd house in a mute sign and afflicted by Mars or Saturn, a perceptible stammer, lisp, or other impediment will be the result. Mercury anywhere in a mute sign afflicted by Saturn causes stammering. If Mars adds his influence by a bad aspect, then the native will talk very quickly, lisp, or pronounce their words badly. When Mercury is in a mute sign in opposition to the Moon, the native will have a defect in their speech. Saturn in the ascendant in a mute sign causes an impediment in speech. The 2nd house governs the vocal organs. If a voice sign is found in the 2nd house in a horoscope, more especially if Venus or Mercury is therein free from affliction, then eloquence or some vocal gift may be predicted. Jupiter indicates that one will offer advice, preach (though they may not practice), and will be a platform speaker. Mars and Jupiter give assertion and make them an orator who can move the masses with their fiery speech. Mercury and Saturn show that they will modify their speech according to the time, circumstances, and the crowd before them.

### Violent Signs
Aries (Mesha) and Scorpio (Virschika) are said to be violent signs. They know "no fear"; they undertake all enterprises with courage and confidence. They are best suited to take risks.

### Human Signs
Gemini (Mithuna), Virgo (Kenya), Aquarius (Kumbha), and the first half of Sagittarius (Dhanus) are called human or humane signs, as these are depicted by human figures on the symbolic globe. Some authors consider Libra (Thulam) to also be humane. Prithyusaa says in Horasara Adhyaya I in Sloka 1 I, that these signs are strong when the lagna falls in one of these signs. "Whoever does not have the predominant planets of their nativity in human signs will be little sociable and not very humane". If the ascendant or principal significators are not in human signs, the native themselves will be estranged from human nature.

### Voice Signs
Gemini (Mithuna), Libra (Thulam) and Aquarius (Kumbha), which are airy signs, are also referred to as musical or voice signs. Some Western authors consider Virgo (Kanya) and Sagittarius (Dhanus) to also be voice signs. Some even include Taurus (Rishaba).
For there to be a voice, there must be an airy medium. This is why all airy signs are considered to be voice signs.

### Bestial Signs
Mesha (Ram), Rishaba (Bull), Simha (Lion), Makara (Goat) and the second half of Dhanus are symbolized by the figures of animals whose names they bear. These are known as the bestial or four-legged signs. According to Prithyusas, these signs are said to be strong when the Meridian (10th house) falls in them. Those born when these signs ascend are said to have the qualities of such animals, such as being bold like the lion or lustful like the goat.

### Dual Signs
Gemini (Mithuna), Sagittarius (Dhanus), and Pisces (Meena) are called twin signs or dual signs, meaning plurality.

### Bicorporal or Double-Bodied Signs
Gemini (Mithuna), which represents a boy and a girl, is one half of Dhanus, which represents a bow and an arrow, and Meena, which represents two fishes bound together by a cord, are the bicorporal or double-bodied signs.

### Signs of Short and Long Ascension
Makara, Kumba, Meena, Mesha, Rishaba, and Mithuna are termed "short ascension signs" because they ascend in a short time. The other six signs take a longer time to ascend and are termed "long ascension signs".

### Signs of Long Ascension
In the Northern Hemisphere, the six signs of Kataka, Simha, Kanya, Thulam, Vrischika, and Dhanus take longer to ascend than the other six signs, and are thus termed as long ascension signs. For places in the Southern Hemisphere, this must be reversed, with the signs of long ascension in the Northern Hemisphere being short ascension signs in the Southern Hemisphere.
