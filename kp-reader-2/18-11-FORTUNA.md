## Fortuna
Fortuna, also known as Pars Fortuna, is the most sensitive and fortunate point in the Zodiac. It moves at a speed much faster than the Moon, and its position is calculated by adding the longitude of the Moon counted from Aries Zero to the longitude of the Ascendant counted from Aries Zero, and then subtracting the longitude of the Sun counted from Aries Zero. This is equivalent to adding the Thithi to the lagna. The position of Fortuna can be found in an Ephemeris, but it varies every moment and moves about one degree within a period of four minutes.

Calculating the Position of Fortuna
When calculating the position of Fortuna, we take into account the ascendant, the Moon, and the Sun, as these three move faster than the other planets. Therefore, births within very short intervals will have the position of Fortuna in different longitudes. For those born around New Moon day, Fortuna is found in the Ascendant; for Sukla Thiruthiyai-born, it will be in the 2nd house; for Sukla Panchami in the third house; and for Sukla Paksha Saptami in the 4th house, and so on. For people born on Full Moon day, Fortuna will be in the 7th house. For all people born during Suklapaksha, Fortuna will be found in the houses 1 to 7, whereas for all people born in Krishna Paksha, Fortuna will be found between the 7th and 12th houses.

In Our Experience, Fortuna Deserves Serious Attention, as It Indicates Certain Results Which Are Not So Clearly Shown by the Aspects Formed by the Transiting Planets to Those in the Natal Chart.

It has been found that the results enjoyed by people born within a few minutes of each other can be diametrically opposite. Therefore, one must try to find out what moves so quickly as to create such different effects. It is true that the ascendant, the meridian, and Fortuna are the three that move very quickly and they alone can provide the correct clues for different results within a short period for the same person, or diametrically opposite results for people born within a short interval in the same latitude and longitude. Consequently, one should not neglect to include Fortuna when constructing a chart and making predictions.

The Effects of Fortuna on the Chart

Fortuna improves the matters signified by the house in which it is located in the chart. As per progression, when benefics form favourable aspects to Fortuna, one will be lucky to have the matters of the house, occupied by Fortuna, enjoyed to the satisfaction of the native. However, planets owning bad houses forming good aspects give adverse results, while evil aspects offer favourable results. Beneficial planets forming evil aspects with Fortuna cause undesirable effects. Similarly, during transits, one is to predict the beneficial nature or the adverse ones according to the aspects formed to Fortuna. Yoga-adhiipathis transiting the position of Fortuna bring unexpected advantages, as Fortuna represents worldly success.

Fortuna and Longevity
Fortuna has nothing to do with longevity. This is because for twins born in the same sign as the Lagna on a New Moon day, or for people born on a New Moon day, Fortuna will be in the Lagna. It is not uncommon for some of these individuals to have short lifespans. There are instances where children born on the New Moon day die in infancy or at any age. Therefore, even though Fortuna is considered to be a beneficial point and the Lagna contributes to long life, Fortuna has nothing to do with longevity.

Similarly, a person's characteristics are not influenced by Fortuna, even though the first house is considered for characteristics. However, Fortuna in the Lagna promises that the person will be fortunate, will gain in their enterprises, lead a happy life, come up by their own efforts and industry, work with confidence, and have a brilliant and successful career.
