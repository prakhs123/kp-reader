## ASTROLOGY - AN OCCULT SCIENCE

Astrology is a noble science; it is as old as the Vedas. It depends on the position of the planets, which is ascertained astronomically, and explains the celestial phenomena and corresponding terrestrial events. The true meaning of astrology is the "Message of the Stars". By using the salient principles of astrology, depending on the position of the planets ascertained astronomically, one can forecast events for the benefit of all, and as such, it is a useful science for interpreting nature. 

"Astronomy is excellent; but it must come up into life to have its full value and not remain there as globes and spaces" - Emerson. 

The whole world is run according to a well-defined plan; nothing happens by chance. Astrology does not permit one to classify anything as an accident, as it explains the cause and effect of events. The divine plan is well arranged and timed with amazing precision. 

Some say that astrology is an art, while others reject it as an idle dream or an illusion. Still others may speak of astrology as though it were an altogether contemptible superstition, and they contemplate with pity those who believe in it. Some of those who have no disappointment or other difficulties in life take pride in saying that they have no faith in astrology and ridicule both the astrologer and the science. Probably they may fear that they may lose their self-importance if they were to recognize astrology. A few others, under wrong impression or with prejudiced ideas, say that astrology is not a science. These people would not have mastered the data on which correct predictions are based. 

Pretending to know everything, they display their ignorance. The antagonists often quote the opinions of such learned men, who do not want to admit that it is a useful science. Learning is the mechanical acquisition of facts and gaining knowledge in any subject, but wisdom is not so. Astrology can be correctly interpreted only by a person endowed with divine grace, and none can call themselves learned without knowing astrology. 

A great theosophist, Mr. Chidambaram Iyer, says that nothing can be more funny than to find young men, especially, taking up astrology as their first subject of attack in their public utterances. It is a subject to which they pay little or no attention except for purposes of ridicule. In my experience, I find a few elderly members behaving worse than such youngsters. 

I submit that astrology is a science and that it can render very useful service to one and all, and create faith even in the sceptic, if one studies this textbook. A knowledge about the history of astrology and the illustrious and eminent sages and savants who practiced astrology would give a better appreciation of the science itself.
