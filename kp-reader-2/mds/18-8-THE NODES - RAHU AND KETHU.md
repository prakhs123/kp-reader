## THE NODES - RAHU AND KETHU

There Is a Vast Amount of Literature Descriptive About the Seven Planets: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn
From time immemorial, these seven planets have been recognized, studied, understood, and honored. The fact that the seven days of the week have been named after the seven planets in the order mentioned above shows that our ancients had a profound knowledge of them and that they, in their characteristic way, defined the planets and named the days of the week after them. However, very little is said about Rahu and Kethu. Out of the galaxy of influential planets, they were taken into cognizance in explaining all heavenly phenomena and recognized the need and existence of Rahu and Kethu. Later, astrologers built up a theory about the existence and influence of these two chayagrahas or shadowy points. Observation and scientific analysis have fully confirmed their intuition, and today we have a meagre but unconnected amount of knowledge of Rahu and Kethu, whereby it is well recognized that they have a distinct, profound, and predictable influence on human lives and destinies. Western science is even poorer in their knowledge of these two points.

Let me collect, collate, and arrange existing knowledge on a logical and understandable basis. We shall consider (1) what Rahu and Kethu are, (2) their natures and characteristics, (3) their influence in various houses, (4) their effects through aspects and combinations, and finally (5) their place in predictive astrology according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati.

What Do We Mean by Rahu and Kethu?
Rahu and Kethu are not physical celestial bodies with a visible form, shape, or mass like the Sun, Moon, and other planets. Therefore, our ancestors assigned them certain houses in the zodiac, considering their influence. Hindu mythology has symbolized them as two parts of a single body. Our sages have gone beyond what scientific observation and deduction can tell us when describing their natures and the divine laws governing them. The descriptions are surprisingly accurate, even though modern minds may view them as childish stories or fairy tales. To understand the profound truths contained in the Hindu Puranas, one must study them deeply and reverently. Those who merely skim them will only recognize their apparent absurdity. Pearls are not gathered by surf riders; only divers can harvest them.

The Forces of Good and Evil

The forces of good and evil have been a part of creation since the beginning of time, and Hindu Theology has symbolized this clash as a war between the Devas and Asuras. The Devas are naturally good and bring good to the world, while the Asuras are naturally evil and bring harm to the world. This war is eternal, and the aim of the creator is for good to ultimately triumph over evil.

The Puranas tell of a churning of the ocean of life by two armies of Devas and Asuras, which resulted in the creation of a divine elephant, a horse, a physician, the Goddess of wealth, and finally, Amrita or immortality. It is natural that strength, skill, wisdom, wealth, and success should come from this struggle between elemental forces, and that good should ultimately prevail. The Supreme Lord is said to have distributed the Amrita among the contestants. He tricked the wicked by taking the form of an alluring woman, Mohini, which literally means "confusing brain". The forces of evil were tempted, while the Devas or forces of good received a share of the Amrita.

One of the Asuras also had an impulse to do good, even though he was naturally evil. He joined the ranks of the Devas and received a share of the Amrita, but was discovered and exposed by the Sun and the Moon. As luminaries, it is reasonable that they should reveal or expose the evil or darkness. The Supreme Lord could not allow a force of evil to become immortal, so he cut it with his sword. The Asura was beheaded, but as a drop of Amrita had been tasted by him, both the sundered parts remained alive, though separated. This is spoken of as the serpent cut into two, the head being called "Rahu" and the body and tail "Ketu". It is natural that Rahu and Ketu should hate the Sun and the Moon, and they are forever at war. Periodically, they succeed in swallowing the Sun and the Moon, but they escape as they are immortal. Eclipses are the moments when Rahu and Ketu swallow the Sun or the Moon. This allegory symbolizes the origin and nature of Rahu and Ketu.

We Shall Consider the Second Tale of the Moon and His Wives
The orbit of the Moon is studied with stars and 27 groups of stars through which the Moon passes in one circuit are called the 27 wives of the Moon. Our Puranas say that the Moon, quite like us mortals, was fonder of some of his wives than of others and thus there was dissatisfaction and jealousy among the wives. Krithika and Rohini were loved best by the Moon and so the rest complained about this preference to their common father, Dhaksha Prajapathi or creator. The father cursed the Moon and ordered that his effulgence should wane each day. The Moon, beloved of Lord Siva or the Supreme Being, ran to Him for succour and was counter-blessed to the effect that he should grow again and wax. Hence, for a fortnight the Moon wanes and for a fortnight waxes till she is full again. The natural phenomenon of the waxing and the waning of the Moon has been allegorically represented in this story and astrologically, the Moon is at her best in the constellations Krithika and Rohini. A prosaic or plain statement of the above would be that, in every lunar month, the Moon passes through the 27 constellations and during a circuit passes through all its phases waning from Full Moon to New Moon and again waxing from New Moon to Full Moon. The Moon is exalted in the constellations Krithika and Rohini.

A Similar Reading of the Previous Allegory About Rahu and Kethu

Rahu and Kethu are not independent planets like the Sun, the Moon, Mars, and others; they do not have different and independent orbits or periods; as two parts of one body, their movement is interrelated or joint; they are at all times at opposite points of the zodiac like the head and the tail; though they are by nature evil and are generally evil in influence, yet by association they are capable of doing good; by association with benefics, they turn beneficial; their juxtaposition with the Sun and the Moon cause eclipses.

Hindu Mythology and Rahu and Kethu

Hindu mythology has symbolically indicated the existence and nature of Rahu and Kethu. Except for a few who have ignored them, most of the ancient sages have divined their influences on the world and mankind. They have described them as "chayagrahas" or shadowy planets, meaning that they have no mass, shape, or substance and that they are celestial points on the Zodiac, with regulated movement and orbit, and that they have a distinct and predictable influence on horoscopes. The motion of these points is denoted and judged, so that their position at any particular moment can be calculated as accurately as the position of the Sun or the Moon, though owing to their nature being without substance, this cannot be verified by visual observation.

Westerners have named the two points Rahu and Kethu as Dragon's Head and Dragon's Tail, respectively, revealing their origin from Hindu Mythological tales. Western astrologers also refer to them as Caput and Cauda. These sensitive points are also called nodes, with the ascending node being Rahu and the descending node Kethu. To understand how these imaginary points are accurately located and their movements are calculated, we must consider the apparent paths in the Heavens of the two planets Sun and Moon. The Sun appears to move along an ellipse of which the Earth is a focus, and the plane of this ellipse is inclined to the terrestrial Equator at an angle of 23 degrees. The Moon, as the satellite of the Earth, moves round it and its path of this orbit is inclined to the Equator at an angle of 28 degrees, so that the planes of the orbits of the Sun and Moon appear to the observer on Earth to be inclined to each other at an angle of 5 degrees. When two circles cut each other, there are two points of interception. The two points at which the orbit of the Moon cuts the orbit of the Sun are called the nodes, and they are exactly 180 degrees apart. The point of intersection formed when the Moon's motion is from South to North is said to be the ascending node and named Rahu, and the point of interception formed when the Moon's motion is from North to South is called the descending node or Kethu. It has been observed in the zodiac at the rate of 19 degrees 0 minutes per year.

Naming of Rahu and Kethu

Solar and Lunar Eclipses
When the transit of the Sun and the Moon is close to the nodes, the Moon can intercept the light of the Sun from reaching the Earth, and thus cause a solar eclipse. The degree of proximity of the planets to the nodes determines the extent or size of the eclipse; when the Moon is within 5 degrees of the node on New Moon day, there will be either a total or annular eclipse of the Sun. If the New Moon is more than 5 degrees away from the node and the Sun is at the node, then we have a partial eclipse. When a full Moon is formed while the Moon is crossing the points of the nodes, the shadow of the Earth falls on the Moon and a lunar eclipse is the result. This too may be full or partial, according as the Sun is at the node or a little away from it.

Thus, the only apparent phenomena that can be connected with Rahu and Kethu are the eclipses when the Sun and the Moon are obscured by shadows. Hence, Hindu astrologers have called these "chaya grahas" or "shadow" planets.

The Nature and Influences of Rahu and Kethu in Predictive Astrology
We have seen that Rahu and Kethu are the points of the ecliptic where the plane of the Moon's orbit intersects the plane of the Sun's orbit. Let us now consider their nature and influences and what their place is in predictive astrology, according to Westerners and Hindu Sages.

Caput Draconis or Moon's North Node
The point of the zodiac where a planet crosses from south to north latitude is called the North Node, and vice versa, the South Node is called the descending node. The motion of the Moon's Node is retrograde, about 3' per day. The Sun, never crossing the ecliptic, has no node; and likewise the Earth which is considered as moving in the same plane as the Sun.
Westerners are of the opinion that Rahu is a benefic, whereas Kethu is a malefic. They do not take these nodes into consideration when predicting events in one's life or in mundane astrology.

According to the Hindus, Rahu and Kethu indicate one born in a low caste; one who may have intrigue with girls; one whose thoughts and actions will be evil; one who will resort to outcaste and low-born as well as ill-bred people. They are also said to be dissatisfied, fond of traveling, and like residences facing south. They may like to go to a mountain, a big jungle, or stay outside, and find pleasure in uttering falsehood, continuing to speak untruth, knowing fully well that they are lying. They will not mind to cohabit with quadrupeds or act like animals, and will be harsh in speech, looking downward while walking or talking with others. If a male, they will use an umbrella; if a lady, they will use a chowrie and an umbrella. Rahu and Kethu also affect the spleen, causing gas trouble and sharp acute pain. Buddhist, snake catchers, asses, rams, wolves, camels, serpents, poisonous insects, dark places, culex mosquitoes, bugs, insects, owls, etc., are said to belong to the nodes. Rahu denotes blackgram and Kethu indicates horsegram. For both the nodes, agate is the precious stone. (Phaladeebika).

Rahu Indicates Paternal Grandfather, Kethu Shows Maternal Grandfather
Both Nodes Can Cause Imprisonment
Rahu Is Attributed to Sinking with the Ship or Drowning, Pleasure with Diseased Women, Amputation, Leprosy, Giddiness, Wrestling, Life in a Cave, etc.
Kethu Is Attributed to Fear Complex, Insanity, Allergy, Leprosy, Injury, Fire Accident, Punishment from Government, Renunciation, Moksha, Wisdom After Sufferings and Bitter Experience, Weakness to Have Pleasure with Other Ladies.

Living in a rented house, enjoying life at others' expense, using others' vehicles, having an office car, taking one in adoption, danger to the offspring, pilgrimage, ill-health to the native, and defects to the children and vision are all judged from the position of Rahu and Kethu in one's horoscope.

Ownership of Houses by Rahu and Kethu

Rahu and Kethu do not own any of the twelve houses, as they are all distributed to the seven planets. However, some sages assign certain signs to the nodes as their owned houses, certain signs as their exalted houses, and the opposite signs as their debilitated houses, etc. These sages do not all agree with each other. For prediction, one can obtain accurate results without taking into consideration their ownership, exaltation, etc.

As Rahu and Kethu do not own any sign, they represent the lord of the sign. However, readers should note that Rahu or Kethu will act as a strong agent to the planet with which it is conjoined. If they are not conjoined with any planet, then they give the results of the planet which aspects them. Only when they are neither conjoined with, nor aspected by any planet, do they represent the lord of the house. This finding can be inferred from the following principle (Uthrakalamrita- Khanda VI Sloka 14 onwards.)

If Rahu or Kethu were to occupy the beneficial houses, 5 or 9, and if they are in conjunction with, or aspected by, the lord of the maraka houses, 2 or 7, then they cause death in their periods, even though the lord of the houses 5 and 9 produce Rajayoga.

If the nodes are in the maraka houses 2 or 7, they can cause danger to life. However, if they are conjoined with or aspected by the lords of 5 or 9, they do not cause death; instead, they increase one's wealth, improve one's health and contribute to a long life. But if the lords of 5 or 9 are conjoined with either of the nodes or if they aspect them, they can cause death.

Therefore, Rahu and Kethu offer the results of the planets with which they are conjoined, or those by which they are aspected, or the ruler of the sign in which they are posited.

If Rahu or Kethu were to be in Gemini, Mithuna, Virgo, Kanni, Sagittarius, Dhanus, or Pisces, Meena, conjoined with the lord of the 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, or 10th house, then the person will enjoy life, gain wealth, and become influential during their periods and sub-periods.

If Rahu and Kethu were to be in a dual rasi, as mentioned above, and if it is conjoined with, or aspected by, any of the lords of the houses 6, 8, or 12, then the person will not receive much benefit in their periods, but they may lose any elder member of the family belonging to their paternal or maternal side.

If Rahu or Kethu were to occupy an evil house, but they are conjoined with the lords of Kendra or Kona house, they cannot produce beneficial results. However, some other scholars say that the nodes can bring fortune even if they are in evil houses. Kalidas does not mention with whom he agrees. He continues to say that Rahu and Kethu will cause harm to the person if they occupy evil houses, even though they may be conjoined with benefics.

If Rahu or Kethu occupy the houses 6, 8, or 12 and receive an aspect from any of the three lords or are conjoined with any of them, then the native will suffer during their dasas.

If Rahu or Ketu are in 6, 8, or 12 and are conjoined with or aspected by the lords of 2 or 7, they affect the native's longevity.

If Rahu or Kethu were to be in either 6th, 8th, or 12th house and if they are connected with the lords of Kendra or Kona houses (1, 4, 7, 10; 1, 5, 9), then the native will enjoy beneficial results during the sub period of such a lord. However, they may suffer from disease, undergo various difficulties, meet with accidents, and either succumb to such injuries or commit suicide or be drowned during the sub period of the lord of 6th, 8th, or 12th house.

If Rahu or Ketu occupy the houses 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, or 10, and if Rajayoga planets conjoin or aspect the nodes, one can expect happiness, health, wealth, children, power, prosperity, and comfortable conveyance during their periods.

According to Kalidasa, Rahu is exalted in Taurus (Vrishaba) and debilitated in Scorpio (Vrischika), while the opposite is true for Kethu. Rahu owns Aquarius (Rumba), and Kethu rules Scorpio (Vrischika). The Moola-trikona sign of Rahu is Gemini (Mithuna), while that of Kethu is Virgo (Kanni). Leo (Simha) and Cancer (Kataka) are the enemy signs of Rahu and Kethu, while Libra (Thulam) and Capricorn (Makara) are their friendly signs. Aries (Mesha) and Sagittarius (Dhanus) are neutral signs for both.

Shri Ramadayalu Sanketanidhi states that Gemini (Mithuna) is the exaltation sign of Rahu and Virgo (Kanni) is the Swakshetra or the sign ruled by Rahu. Sagittarius (Dhanus) is the sign of exaltation of Kethu and Pisces (Meena) is owned by Kethu. Saturn (Sani) is also mentioned.

Some astrologers believe that Scorpio (Vrischika) is the exaltation sign of Rahu and Aquarius is the sign of exaltation of Kethu. However, due to the confusion and contradiction between authors, it is best for new students to leave this topic alone. Kalidasa states that Rahu and Kethu are very strong when exalted. Rahu is beneficial when it is in any of the houses 4, 7, 9, 10, or 11, while Kethu is favourable if it is in the 3rd house.

Again, Another Doubt Arises Among the Students:
Putradhosha

What is said that Rahu and Kethu are always 180 degrees away from each other? If Rahu is in the 11th house, then Kethu must be in the 5th house. It is said that Rahu in 11 gives many children, whereas Kethu in 5 threatens loss of children, stillborn children, or abortion. Does this not appear to be funny? No, Rahu in 11 will protect the children during its dasa and its sub-periods, whereas Kethu in 5 will affect health or cause abortion during its period and sub-period. Any planet indicating any result can offer such during its period and sub-period. Rahu's beneficial result cannot be cancelled by Kethu's malefic ones and vice versa; each will operate separately in their respective periods.

Findings of Hindu Sages Regarding the Effects of Relative Positions of Rahu and Other Planets
Several authors have discussed the results to be expected due to certain relative positions of Rahu and other planets. For example, Mars, Rahu, and Saturn in the 8th house can deprive one of their nostrils; Mars in 6, Rahu in 7, and Saturn in 8 can cause loss of partner and independent life; Venus in 2, Moon in 1, Mercury and Sun in 12, and Rahu in 5 can involve one in murder and punish them with imprisonment; if Rahu is in 7 and is strong, the complexion of the partner will be black; Rahu in the 7th house reduces the strength of the fecundity in the female to nothing; Saturn and Rahu in 7 can cause hysteria; Mercury and Rahu in 6 can cause typhoid; Venus, Saturn, and Rahu can cause venereal disease; Jupiter and Rahu can cause surgical treatment for birth control; Mars, Saturn, and Rahu can cause accidents; and Sun and Rahu can indicate difficulties through government officials, litigation, loss of profession and prestige, worry, anxiety, and inferiority complex, among other things.

Rahu or Kethu Will Prove Beneficial

If they are conjoined with or aspected by the lords of beneficial houses, or if they occupy the constellation and sub of the planets owning favourable houses, i.e., for one born in the ascendant Capricorn, Venus is a benefic by owning the 10th house. Hence, Rahu will prove to be a benefic if it is conjoined with or aspected by Venus, or if Rahu occupies the constellations belonging to Venus, i.e., Bharani, Poorvapalguni, and Poorvashada, or the sub of Venus which will extend to 2 degrees 13 minutes 20 seconds in each constellation. The same principle applies to Kethu also.

Rahu in the constellation of the lords of 6, 8, and 12 will produce undesirable results, even though the house (solar mansion and bhava) may be considered as beneficial. Upachayasaana. Similarly, Rahu or Kethu will do the greatest evil, causing death to the person in its period or sub-period if it is in the constellation of the planet in Bhadhaksthana, or if it is in that of the owner of the Bhadhakasthana, or in any manner connected with Kendhradipathi, or occupies the constellation of the lords of 2 and 7, or is conjoined with, or aspected by them.

Suppose one is born in Thula Lagna (Libra Ascendant) - as it is a movable sign, the 11th sign is Bhadhakasthana. If there is any planet in Leo, Simha the 11th sign, then note the constellation of the occupant. If Mars is in 11, then Rahu in Mrigasirisha, Chithra, or Dhanishta will prove to be evil, whether it is in the 8th, 9th, 12th, 1st, 4th, or 5th house counted from Lagna. It is found that one passes away in Rahu's sub or sub-period, irrespective of the house it occupies. If there is no planet in Bhadhakasthana, then take the lord of that house. In this example, Leo is the Bhadhakasthana and its lord is Sun. Hence, Rahu in Sun's sub or in any of the three constellations of Sun, Karthikai, Uthrapalguni, or Uthrashada will definitely prove to be a Maraka. Thus, one is to judge, when alone correct prediction can be offered.

Rahu and Kethu are Stronger than Other Planets
Suppose Venus and Rahu are conjoined in Pisces, Libra, or Taurus. Even if Venus is exalted, Vargothamamsa, or occupying either the day house or night house, Rahu will predominate and offer the results of Venus to a greater extent than Venus itself. If Venus is the significator, then Rahu takes its effect and acts as a strong significator of the matter in one's horoscope.
If the lord of 2, 6, or 10 is conjoined with or aspects Rahu or Kethu, then the node so connected will indicate one's profession and one will get into service during the node's sub-periods if the lord of the constellation is also a significator.
If the lord of 2, 7, or 11 or the planets in 2, 7, or 11 aspect Rahu or Kethu, marriage will be celebrated in Rahu's sub-periods, provided the lord of the constellation is also a significator.
Rahu or Kethu in 2, 5, or 11, receiving good aspects, will give children in their periods and sub-periods in any of the following stars: Arudhra (Mercury and Rahu periods), Swathi (Venus and Rahu periods), Aswini (Kethu and Mars), Makam (Sun and Kethu), Moolam (Jupiter and Kethu).
Thus, it can be seen that Rahu and Kethu are much stronger than the planets conjoined with them or the lord of the sign in which either of them is posited.

Rahu and Kethu are declared to be evil by Hindu sages. However, it is a fact that they are not always evil; under certain circumstances, they can prove to be more auspicious than any other planet. If Rahu or Kethu is in the constellation of the lords of beneficial houses and is conjoined with or aspected by benefics by lordship, they will offer the most favourable and agreeable results.

If Rahu or Ketu are in a sign, they will give the results of not only the matters signified by that house and sign, but also the matters indicated by the other sign ruled by the same lord. Except for the Sun and Moon, each of the other planets rules two signs, so the nodes will offer the results of both signs.

Rahu and Kethu are to be taken as the agents of the lord of the sign, the lord of the star, and the lord of the sub. They are capable of producing the results caused by the combination of the sign lord, star lord, and sub lord. For example, if a person has Rahu in Taurus at 26-36, it is in Venus' sign Taurus, Mars' star Mrigasirisha, and Jupiter's sub. This offers one the job of a manager in an automobile industry in Rahu Dasa, Jupiter sub period, Venus sub sub, and Mars shukashma. The results of Rahu and Kethu are invariably modified by the lords of the constellations, sign, and sub.

Rahu in the Constellation of Sun

Rahu is in the constellation of Sun, i.e., Karthikai, Uthrapalguni or Uthrashada. High fever, heart disease, giddiness, enmity, quarrels, unpleasant domestic environments, fear, suspicion of the partner, lack of trust in anyone, changes in occupation and residence, suffering from contagious diseases, and mental unrest are indicated, especially when Sun rules over evil houses. However, if Sun is a Rajayogadhipathi, promotion, reputation, name, fame, cessation of enmity, and charity are indicated.

Rahu in the Constellation of Moon, i.e., Rohini, Hastham, or Sravanam, indicates success in agriculture, a good crop, the purchase of cows, an increase in income, a pleasant life, life with kith and kin, sea voyages, and the purchase of wet lands. However, if Moon is afflicted or ill-posited, or if it owns evil houses, it threatens danger by drowning, trouble with micturition, a change of residence and transfer, loss or danger to the wife, pain and swelling in the limbs, injury to the person, mental worries, and anxieties.

Rahu in the Constellation of Mars, i.e., Mrigasirisha, Chithra, or Dhanishta, Threatens Loss by Fire, Theft, or Robbery; Loss in Litigation; Loss of Money; Difficulties; Sorrow; Open Inimical Activity; Fondness for Easy and Dissolute Habits; Disputes; Irritation; Rash Action; Violence; Disharmony with Partner; Calamities; Failure of Memory; Danger from Officials, Government, the Police, and Military, etc.; Chances for Imprisonment, etc. If Mars is a Benefic, Service in Jail Department and Other Favourable and Agreeable Results are Indicated.

Rahu in Mercury's Constellation: Ashlesha, Jyeshta, or Revathi

This indicates that one will have a large number of acquaintances, friends, and benefactors; they will be fond of frequent travels; they will earn satisfactorily in many ways and save much; they will gain royal favor; they will come in contact with strangers and enter into agreements with them; they will lead a happy life and have many children; they will purchase conveyances and gain through business agency. 

If Mercury is the lord of an evil house, the person will be a fraud, will give their word easily to everybody but never keep it or fulfill it; they will appear outwardly to be honest but inwardly be cunning and a cheat, so enemies will increase in number because of their own actions; they will never hesitate to utter falsehood or commit forgery; they will suffer from Vitamin B deficiency and typhoid.

Rahu in the Constellation of Jupiter, Punarvasu, Visakham, or Poorvapathrapada, if Jupiter rules beneficial houses, promises that the enmity will come to an end. One can come out victorious at elections, win in litigation, enjoy the good-will of government servants, acquire wealth, have the birth of children, increase pleasure, gain influence and position through persons in power, have good relationships with politicians, benefit from superiors, have success in all efforts, have happy celebrations in the family, and visit holy places and take dips in sacred rivers.

Rahu in the Constellation of Venus: Effects

Rahu in the constellation of Venus, i.e., in Bharani, Poorvapalguni to Poorvashada, will bring good fortune and happiness. Persons will purchase vehicles and costly articles, fancy ones, and good furniture, on hire purchase or will import them. They will have good relationships with relatives, especially ladies, and will acquire wealth and compromise. They will have friendly alliances, gain advantages from superiors, and have promotion and popularity. Marriage and the birth of children are also likely. 

However, if Venus rules over evil houses, they will be liable to deception and suffer from venereal disease. They will have troubles from enemies, be unfriendly with the other sex, suffer ill-repute and scandal through ladies, and experience loss of money and honour.

Rahu in the Constellation of Saturn:

Rahu in the constellation of the malefic Saturn, i.e., in Pushyam, Anuradha, or Uthrattadhi, threatens ill-repute, injury by the person falling down or something falling on the person, bad association, and misunderstanding with a partner.
