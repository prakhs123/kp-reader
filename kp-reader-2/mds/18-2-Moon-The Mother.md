## Moon: The Mother
In astrology, the Moon and the Sun are generally mentioned, even though neither is a planet in the strictest sense of the word.

Astronomy: The Moon is the planet closest to the Earth. It is the only planet in the Solar System that orbits around the Earth. The Sun is said to be the generator of power, while the Moon is considered to be the conductor of power lent by the Sun. Only one half of the Moon receives light from the Sun and this portion alone is illuminated at any one time. The Moon shines only by the reflected light of the Sun.

The rays of the Sun reflected by the Moon dispel the darkness of the night on Earth, just as light reflected from a mirror placed in the Sun removes the darkness inside a house. Therefore, the nature of the Moon's light is the same as that of sunlight, but it is not self-luminous. The distance between the Earth and Moon is approximately 238,000 miles. It orbits around the Earth, which in turn orbits around the Sun.

Suppose a child holds the hand of its mother; the child goes around her rapidly. But the mother with the child makes a large circle around a lighthouse. The child will be at times in between the mother and the lighthouse. On some occasions, the mother will be between the child and the lighthouse. When the child is in the line joining the mother and the lighthouse, the mother cannot see the lighthouse. In this manner, a solar eclipse is caused. But if the mother is in between the child and the lighthouse in the same joining line, the mother prevents the light from falling on the child. That is, the Earth is in between the Moon and the Sun, and the Moon does not receive light from the Sun. Thus, a lunar eclipse is caused. Eclipses are formed in this manner whenever all three are in one line.

The Moon is small in size. The diameter of the Earth is approximately 7,800 miles, while that of the Moon is only 2,200 miles. No water is said to be found on the Moon. But at the time of the Full Moon, we notice the tides rise as high as 40 feet. Actually, the ebb and flow of the oceans are caused by the influence of the Moon on the Earth.

Mythology: Moon as the Virgin Mary of Roman Catholics and Nourishing Mother of the Heavens
The Moon, also known as Luna or Diana, is the queen of the night and the twin sister of Apollo. She is the goddess and huntress who governs chastity and fertility, and is the daughter of Leo and Zeus, known as Artemis by the Greeks. It is said that the Sun gives spirit and life to all the planets, while the Moon rules over the lives of beings on Earth. The Sun represents individuality, while the Moon shows one's personality, and is also said to represent the mother of a person born by night. The Sun is masculine and the Moon is feminine, so a person born under the rulership of the Moon is said to be timid, vacillating, receptive, and convertible. The Moon is a watery planet, while the Sun is a fiery one, making the Moon a fruitful planet.

The Moon transits quickly through all twelve signs of the Zodiac in 27 days, 7 hours, and 48 minutes, and is said to govern our daily happenings. When it transits a favourable sign, a person may feel jubilant, and when it passes in an unfavourable sign, the same person may feel depressed. Therefore, it is important to understand the Moon and its effects. He will be attached to his mother and will be very much devoted to her.

Astrology: The Moon
The Moon is a nocturnal, cold, changeable, moist, receptive, and feminine planet. The fourth sign of the Zodiac, called Cancer or Katakam, is ruled by the Moon. This sign is just prior to the sign Leo, which is owned by the Sun. In Hindu Mythology, it is said that the Moon loves Rohini most, and it is exalted in Taurus, or Rishaba, which contains the Rohini star. The Moon moves around 13 degrees on average each day, and is very strong when it passes through Taurus. It is very weak and debilitated when it transits in the sign Scorpio, or Vrischika.

The Moon governs impregnation, conception, the birth of a child, animal instinct, union, and the embryo. It also rules the infant stage of a person, and has a powerful influence on their life. An afflicted Moon at the time of birth can cause frequent ailments and prevent proper growth. It can cause stomach upset and frequent vomiting, which reduces vitality. The effect of the Moon depends on the relative disposition of other planets, the aspects it receives, and the sign it occupies at the time of one's birth.

The Moon is a cold planet, and an afflicted Moon can often cause colds and fevers. Its characteristic is changeability, so its influence is often unsettling. If one is in service, they may have a desire for frequent changes. They may not stay in the same premises, and may change their residence frequently. Even in their room, they may be constantly rearranging their books and changing the position of furniture, curtains, and tables. Unless Saturn forms a favourable aspect, they cannot be steady. Just as the Moon appears different on different days, people born with the Moon as their ruling planet will be unsettled, wavering, and vacillating.

The Moon, representing the mother and owning the fourth house, indicates that the person will love their country and home. They will be attached to their mother and devoted to her.

Moon is known as Mathi, the mind. Mercury governs intelligence, and good aspects between Moon and Mercury give the native a fertile imagination, deep feelings, and emotion. Adverse aspects, however, offer indecision, lack of mental balance, a desire to lie and spread false rumours, and suffering from over-anxiety.

Moon, receiving good aspect from Venus, develops in the native a taste for music, art, painting, and scented, as well as a keen imagination and love for all pleasurable pursuits. Evil aspects, however, portend inconstancy with lady friends and female relatives. Excesses can cause digestive troubles.

Moon and Mars, when favourably disposed, offer extreme liberality and a frank nature. The native will be bold and inclined to make frequent journeys which will prove to be profitable. Adverse aspects, however, indicate that the person will be impulsive, rash, and reckless, and will develop strong attractions to the opposite sex, causing ill health and bringing ill reputation. These two planets also govern the monthly course of the ladies. Good aspects are fruitful, but evil aspects cause much pain and other troubles connected with menstruation.

Jupiter and Moon in favourable aspects give magnanimous ideas, a hopeful disposition, good imagination, and optimism. But if the aspects are bad, the native will be reckless and extravagant.

Saturn with its beneficial rays to Moon makes one patient, persistent, steady, cautious, and ever inclined to hoard money. The native will be able to concentrate. Unfavourable aspects, however, depress them and make them funky; there will be fear complex, inferiority complex, and pessimism. They cannot concentrate or meditate.

Uranus and Moon will develop in the native a taste for hypnotism, mesmerism, occultism, astrology, etc., and will make them independent. Adverse aspects, however, portend eccentricity. The native will be perverted and very hasty.

Neptune and Moon will make one proficient in fine arts, instrumental music, occultism, spiritualism, etc. Adverse aspects, however, threaten them with neurasthenic complaints, hysteria, insanity, incoherence in thought and speech, and create in them immoral and perverse sexual desires. Thus, Moon influences the brain, indicating our reaction for every result we have for the efforts we make. As Moon governs water, the native will have the desire to cross the sea, make long journeys, etc.

Moon also governs the stomach and the breasts of ladies. Good digestion or otherwise, beauty of the breasts, and her ability to feed her own child with breast milk or not, depend on the aspects which Moon receives. Mercury and Sun forming good aspect give proper digestion and assimilation. Saturn aspecting Moon gives very small breasts, Jupiter makes them very big, Venus adds beauty to them, and Mars keeps them strong and attractive.

Sun indicates the native's public life, holding high positions with authority and power. But Moon denotes family life, the home, and personal and private affairs. It also shows the multitude and the masses. Moon is considered to govern 'AP' or water power, denoting wells, ponds, tanks, rivers, fresh water, bays, and oceans. Hence, it is concerned with liquids, aquatic animals, and objects found under water, like pearls.

Profession
Being a watery planet, the native may be employed in the shipping department, navy, water analysis, or water-supply department. He may deal in salt, fish, corals, pearls, perfumes, flowers, liquids, kerosene, petrol, milk, and boilers. Farmers, vegetable and fruit growers, and suppliers or dealers in such commodities are also governed by the Moon. Nurses, cooks, stall managers, launderers, and other occupations are also ruled by the Moon.

One may be a mechanical engineer in water-works, or if the Moon were to be in a movable or common sign, they may be a captain in a steamer or ship. If the Moon and Mars form good aspects and either is in Scorpio, they may deal with boilers. Venus forming an aspect denotes a dealer in parboiled rice, as Venus represents food. An aspect from Venus to the Moon alone shows that the native will be a dealer in milk products. If Saturn also aspects, they may deal in materials found at the bottom of the sea, such as conch-shells. Mars, Moon, and Sun indicate dealings in salt. Mars, Moon, and Venus govern aerated waters. Moon, Sun, and Venus indicate nursing, and if Jupiter is also connected with them, it indicates midwifery. Jupiter, Mercury, and Moon denote novel writings, as well as those who inspect accounts and internal auditors. Moon in the third house connected with the lord of profession indicates good salesmen and street hawkers. Thus, the modification of other planets will help in selecting one of the many indications of the Moon.
