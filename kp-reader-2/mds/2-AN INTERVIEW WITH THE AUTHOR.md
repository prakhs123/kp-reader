## An Interview with the Author

Visitor: Is astrology a science?

I: Why do you doubt it? It is a divine science that reads the divine plan by referring to nature, which is the creation of God.

Visitor: It is not clear.

I: It is a science. Birth and death, pleasure or pain, gain or loss, health and wealth are all experienced according to the divine plan. The only scientific and correct way of understanding the divine plan is by applying the principles of astrology.

Visitor: Is it possible to predict anything and everything?

I: For every science, there are limitations. This is why research is being done to improve existing theories and to supplement them. Efforts are being made to get as close to perfection as possible.

Visitor: Within that limitation, can one predict accurately?

I: Yes. However, the fate of the consultant should also be taken into account. Even if the astrologer is highly knowledgeable, they may still make mistakes and give wrong predictions if the querist is unfortunate at the time of the event.

Visitor: If it is a science, how can predictions go wrong? 

I: Isn't medicine a science? For example, if people suffering from typhoid are admitted to a hospital and all of them have a positive Widal test, the doctor administers the same medicine. Say, one aged 24 and the other 30 die, while the third has a relapse, but the others recover. What do you say? Same science, same disease, same medicine.

Visitor: True

I: Again, don't you know that the great scientists in America are trying to land on the moon? They have been successful on many occasions, but Apollo 13 failed. Why? Is science wrong then? While applying, some mistake must have crept in. Similarly, astrologers may also fail.

Visitor: But most astrologers fail in many predictions. 

I: How do you classify them as astrologers? Because they know the spelling of the sun and moon, or they produce some slokas, or they are born into that family, or they continue to call themselves old, veteran astrologers in spite of their failures? If you approach such people, you will lose faith and call it a pseudo-science.

Visitor: Suppose I want to do something, can astrology help me with that?

I: I told you that our brains have limitations, and science also has its limitations. Within those limits, if you ask the right questions, it can be predicted.

Visitor: Can one correctly predict whether a pregnant mother will have a male or female child?

I: Predictions on natal charts are given taking the moment of birth, which is never changeable. It is only one moment. For example, if a boy is born and later becomes a female, it is impossible to say from the chart whether it belongs to a boy or a girl, as the moment of birth and hence the horoscope remains the same. Similarly, the moment of epoch, which can only be calculated after the birth, is a single moment. If one does research taking the moment of epoch, it also cannot provide any insight. Twins are born at the same time, one boy and one girl, so no method has been found so far. Research is being carried out, but at present there is no science to predict this. It should be discovered. If anyone claims that they can predict, they are bluffing. If you had only contact with them, you would not be entirely wrong in deciding that the science is a pseudo one, but you are correct in saying that the so-called scientist is wrong and you should not overestimate yourself and pass any remarks on the developing science.
Medicine is being developed day by day in leaps and bounds. Even if medicine can be developed to a good extent, it cannot bring back the lives of all the dead. Everywhere there is a limitation.

Visitor: If that is the case, what is the use of astrology?

I: Don't you see every day that people carry the dead from the hospital? When some people are admitted to the hospital and don't walk back home, but are carried away to the cremation ground, are you wise in advising people not to go to the hospital? How many are cured? Does this not depend on their destiny? Similarly, if a few predictions fail, are you to conclude that astrology is not a science? Take the instances where a person expects something, but experiences something else as predicted by the astrologer. The astrologer does not know your affairs as much as you do. He takes only the moment when you meet him or takes a number from you. He is still able to predict correctly. This event, which he predicts, is not expected by you. Then what do you say?

Visitor: It may be a guess.

I: No! A guess comes after knowing the past. Here, he does not know the past. A guess can be the habit of a few astrologers after reading newspapers or knowing the past and present circumstances. If they come up with the correct answer, they jump to conclusions. If they fail, they offer lame excuses. They never take the time to determine whether the method they follow is universally applicable. Even when they know that it is only correct in a few cases and fails miserably in many, they have no other choice. They have to make a living; their business has to go on. Such astrologers, without opening the eyes of others or simply throwing dust in their eyes, apply general principles and carry on their living; it appears as though they do not take the time to find out what happened to the predictions they offered, but presume that they will come true; or they don't care whether it proves correct or not; or they probably know that if it is correct, then all is well; if not, the world is wide.
Only such astrologers bring ridicule to the divine science without bringing to the attention of the queriers the limitations.

Visitor: Why shouldn't they speak out as you do?

I: I know my limitations. I openly say, I don't care what others think of me. Speak the truth. Be honest. Acknowledge your limitations. Where you can be very precise, state the result. Where you can't, as the science has not developed to that extent, don't take the subject; acknowledge your limitations.

Visitor: I agree. I see no use in dabbling in subjects for which there are no specific, clear-cut, and exhaustive rules. I want to do research on natal charts for the rest of my life and find truths that are useful to each individual, to find out all matters connected with them and how they fit into modern living conditions. What is the point of wasting time trying to find out "how many wicks were in the lamp when one's mother delivered; how many attendants were there at the time of delivery," and so on?

Visitor: So, you restrict your research to natal horoscopes alone?

I: Yes. Don't you know that astrology has many branches? I want to serve the masses, so I do this research. It is advisable that every doctor specializes in some branch of medical science; a few brain specialists, a few opticians, a few dentists, a few E.N.T., and so on. Similarly, in engineering, a few mechanical, a few electrical, a few sanitary, and so on. Hence, one can't underestimate the other. Each can develop in any one branch. One can't judge the ability of the other. So let me continue my research.

Visitor: Why can't you take up politics?

I: This branch of science is still in its infancy. In my lifetime, I want to complete my research on natal charts before taking up Mundane Astrology.

Visitor: Don't you think you can offer thrilling predictions and, if by chance any of these come true, you will become popular?

I: Yes, yes. Failures will likely outnumber successes as it is not yet perfected. So the same attempt will bring ridicule and shame. Why should I take the risk or guess and be a laughingstock in the market?

Visitor: If I ask you to use the available scientific rules to make a prediction, what would be the accuracy of the prediction?

I: When science is incomplete and imperfect, the results can be incorrect. My prediction will be correct if the person in question has a good time, but it will fail if the event predicted does not occur during the querist's unfortunate period. Many people give wrong times of birth, and some don't even know their date of birth. These people often hold high positions, and different people cast and discuss various charts. These people are not advancing the science by researching correct charts; they are taking a chance. However, I choose charts after verifying their accuracy.

Visitor: Don't you have any method by which you can predict events to someone who doesn't have a horoscope?

I: It was for that purpose that I did research on Horary Astrology and I have come very close to offering 100% accurate results.

Visitor: Have you published any books on this subject?

I: Yes, it is ready. By applying the horary system, I can predict.

Visitor: Why can't you do it?

I: It is being done and it helps them take advantage of the opportunity.

Visitor: Suppose I ask how long a politician will live? 

I: First of all, I am not concerned with who rules, whether it be X or Y, or how long they will remain in power. If I must give an answer to please you, I will do so, but only for your sake.

Visitor: Have you ever predicted correctly?

I: I do not believe in predicting that X will have a difficult time in any year. However, I do give dates. I have been very accurate in the cases of the late Jawaharlal Nehru, the late Mr. Lal Bahadur Shastri, the resignation of Mr. T.T.K., and a few more.

Visitor: Why shouldn't you publish beforehand?

I: As I told you, I am not interested in their longevity. Secondly, since a third person puts the query and I answer him because I have to please him with a correct prediction. Why should I publish and incur the displeasure of the person concerned? I do not want the friendship of such people nor enmity. My prediction may be interpreted in any way. So, my caravan will go on doing research work and finding some truth for the benefit of the people rather than to benefit myself with such cheap popularity and use astrology for my pot-boiling. I work to improve the science and make it a reliable science.
