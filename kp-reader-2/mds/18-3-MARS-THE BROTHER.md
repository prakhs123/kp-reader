## Mars - The Brother
Astronomy: Mars is one of the outer planets, located nearer to the Earth than any of the other planets such as Jupiter or Saturn. The mean distance between the Sun and the Earth is approximately 93 million miles, while the mean distance between the Sun and Mars is 141 million miles. Both Earth and Mars orbit the Sun at different velocities, with Mars always outside the circle traced by the Earth.

To illustrate this concept, imagine two cows tied up to one post with ropes 93 yards and 141 yards long. They go round the post, making concentric circles with 93 and 141 yards as the radii. The cow tied up with the longer rope will make a bigger round than the other and will always be outside the circle described by the other cow with 93 yards rope. Similarly, Mars makes a bigger circle than that of the Earth and is always outside the circle formed by the Earth. Only the Moon, Mercury, and Venus can appear between the Earth and the Sun on certain occasions, while Mars, Jupiter, and other outer planets can never travel between the Sun and the Earth and are always outside.

Mars completes its journey round the Sun in 687 days, making a Martian year 687 of our solar days. Mars is smaller than the Earth, with a diameter of approximately 4,200 miles, which is double that of the Moon. The mass of Mars is a little above one tenth of that of the Earth. It is found that Mars rotates about itself in 24 hours 37 minutes 23 seconds in the same direction as that of the Earth. A Martian Sidereal Day is roughly 1,026 of our solar days. Mars closely resembles the Earth in one aspect; that is, the axis, about which it rotates, is tilted up at an angle of 24 degrees 50 minutes. Just like the Earth, Mars has temperate and frigid zones.

Mars is red in colour and so its light is ruddy in appearance. It shines in the night so very brilliantly that it is easily distinguishable from other stars and planets. Mars is not clearly visible both in the early morning and in the evening immediately after sunset when it is nearer to the Sun. However, when the longitude between the Sun and Mars increases, the latter shines more brilliantly than the brightest of the stars (Sirius).
Mars is the brother of Earth.

Mythology: Mars

Mars is said to be the deity of the Buddhists and the God of the Romans. It is the God of war and also of hunting. Mars (or Ares in Greek; Artes in Egyptian; Angaraka, Mangala, Kuja in Sanskrit and Savvai in Tamil) is the son of Jupiter (Zeus) and his wife Hera. He is the God of dispute, destruction, and war and was disliked by one and all because of his warlike nature. Many a time, other Gods wounded him and conquered him. Once he was imprisoned by his conqueror, but Mercury came to his relief and freed him. He loved Venus who reciprocated satisfactorily. Mars was held in high esteem and honor in the Roman Empire. In the Bible, Mars is symbolized by the Devil. It is the God of force and energy. According to the Hindus, Mars is God Muruga, Subramanya, Kumaraswamy, Velayudham, or Vadivel, meaning the fighting power. He is considered to be the Commander-in-Chief of the celestial armies. Mars rules over "Sama Veda".

Mars ruled the first month of the Roman Year, March, and the eighth month of the Roman Year, October. Certain days in those months were given over to Martian ceremonies. Until the time of Augustus, Mars had only two temples at Rome; both were connected to military operations. One of the temples was an altar, while the other was the gate through which the army used to march.

Astrology: Mars is a dry, fiery planet, masculine in nature. It rules Aries and Scorpio, is exalted in Capricorn, debilitated in Cancer, and determined in Taurus and Libra. Mars is associated with energy, both constructive and destructive, depending on its position, aspects, and location in the horoscope. Mars has much to do with one's ambition and desires. It symbolizes the senses and rules over the animal instinct in humans. Generally, Mars is considered a malefic planet. If it is not afflicted and receives favorable aspects, it can offer qualities such as self-confidence, endurance, impulse for ventures, strength, courage, combativeness, sharp wit, the ability to argue, a go-ahead spirit, quick mental activity, extraordinary muscular strength, great organizing ability, power for practical execution, independent spirit, force of character, strong determination, ambition, and leadership.

If one is intelligent and sensible, they will not oppose a Martian, as they will select the opportune moment to strike and withdraw. It is always advisable to make all efforts to enter into compromise with Martians instead of widening the gap and inviting further trouble. Martians can combine physical delight and spiritual well-being when they live on a higher plane of consciousness.

If Mars is weak and afflicted in a horoscope, the native will be rash, lose their temper quickly, and be foolhardy. As Mars rules over contentions and strifes, they will be quarrelsome. If Mars is afflicted and weak, all the good qualities mentioned above will be absent, and they will submit to others. They may be fond of drink. Whenever there is any difference of opinion, they will rely more on the application of brute force than to argue intelligently and try to convince logically. They will not hesitate to take the aggressive part.

Mostly, the worst type of sexualities is governed by Mars. Such people will satisfy their sexual hunger in novel ways, not minding the pain they give to their partners. They may adopt malpractices. Martians are said to be extremists. If they are true to anyone, they will go to any extent, even at the risk of their lives, to save their friends. They will sacrifice anything.

Beneficial Mars makes the natives adventurous and independent. They do not relish suggestions from others, but they will act according to their own conscience. They dislike small undertakings, but prefer to execute large projects. Many pioneers, leaders, heroes, warriors, and explorers are the sons of Mars. "Mars is the chief governor for brother and landed property."

Physical Features: People born with Mars as their ruling planet will have a white complexion with a shade of red. They will be tall and muscular, with pimples on their face and round eyes. Their waists will be narrow and their bones will be full of red bone marrow.

Aspects with Other Planets: Mars forming a good aspect with the Sun makes the body of the native hot and susceptible to sharp and acute complaints such as smallpox and high fever. A good aspect between these two planets gives abundant energy and good health, as well as immunity and resistance against infectious diseases. Both planets give courage, frankness, and enthusiasm, making the native self-made and lucky. If they form a bad aspect, the native is liable to suffer from fever, accidents, wounds, explosions, etc. There will be unnecessary disputes, excitement, and difficulties due to rash actions, as well as an unpleasant and unhappy domestic life. The native will get easily irritated and become violent, and will be worried.

Mars forming a good aspect with the Moon indicates that the native will be very generous, ambitious, bold, and enthusiastic. Robust health, especially for ladies (as both planets govern the menstrual periods), a strong constitution, and good appearance are given by Mars. Evil aspects between these two planets threaten the native with rash and impulsive action. He may be reckless and go to extremes without considering the consequences. Both health and reputation will suffer, and accidents will be frequent, with the possibility of profuse bleeding. Beneficial aspects promise an improvement in status and satisfactory financial success. Adverse aspects portend losses, slander, the end of life for any near and dear relative, misunderstandings, silly quarrels, and irritation.

If Mars receives good aspects from Mercury, one will demonstrate a love for work; they will quickly complete all the duties assigned to them. This aspect offers vitality, vigor, and valor. Promotion, prosperity, success in competition and disputes, a bright outlook on life, and an adventurous spirit are indicated by the beneficial aspects between Mars and Mercury. Adverse aspects will make the native a cheat, a scoundrel, and a thief. Additionally, the native themselves may lose by theft. They may be swindled by others.

Good Aspect from Jupiter to Mars Shows Success

The good aspect from Jupiter to Mars shows that the native will be determined, exercising free will with a go-ahead spirit. He will be noble and succeed in competitive examinations, gaining financial success. Logicians and lawyers will have the favourable aspect between Mars and Jupiter, as will bank agents and political leaders, who will have strong and beneficial aspects between these two planets.

Adverse Aspect between Jupiter and Mars Causes Loss

Adverse aspect between these two planets causes extravagant expense, loss through litigation, loss through investment in banks or through gambling. There may also be criminal proceedings and prosecutions, as well as de-promotion or transfer to undesirable localities or sections.

Good Aspect between Venus and Mars

A good aspect between Venus and Mars is indeed very beneficial, as the peaceful and passionate Venus will soften and tone down the fiery nature of Mars, making the native courteous, upright, accommodating, and diplomatic. He will try to lead a peaceful and harmonious life. Occasionally, the amorous nature of the native will overcome and conquer his free-will and independent spirit. He will be fond of sports and pleasurable pursuits. Courage, confidence, and capability to do business will help him to amass wealth and possess landed properties with gardens, etc. He may spend to his entire satisfaction and enjoy his life a good deal, forming fortunate attachments with the ladies and gaining popularity.

Bad Aspect between Mars and Venus

A bad aspect between Mars and Venus can make one lavish, reckless, extravagant, and unmindful of any loss that he may incur. To satisfy his lust and desire, he will do anything and mingle himself with low-class women or low-paid servants. A few will even go to the extent of borrowing from low-class people and squandering everything. If one were to exercise his or her strong will, one can avoid these troubles, unlike those caused by the evil aspect between Jupiter and Saturn or Jupiter and Uranus. These evil results are the outcome of one's own mean actions, so one should try to avoid troubles, ill-repute, slander, disgrace, domestic unhappiness, etc., and the dirty venereal diseases, by exercising his or her strong will, determination, and action.

Favorable Aspects between Saturn and Mars

Favorable aspects between Saturn and Mars are very beneficial, as Saturn does not allow one to be impulsive, rash, and aggressive. Instead, it regulates, makes one bold and courageous, and gives the native force or character. Patience, endurance, health, and activity with enthusiasm and executive ability will reward the native amply and offer good rise in life to occupy covetable posts. He never shrinks from work, nor has any stage-fear. Even if he has to face many difficulties due to other combinations, he will go through the ordeal successfully.

Adverse Aspects

Adverse aspects are, in some cases, very dangerous. Both are malefic by nature and if they also own evil houses, one has to exercise care during the joint periods of these two planets or during such periods, when they form aspects either by transit or by progression. One will be rash, get quickly irritated, become uncontrollable, be hasty, and even commit murder. We have heard of cold murders without any previous contemplation and planning but committed suddenly on any provocation followed by immediate surrender to the police authorities. Without exception, we can see the evil aspects in the horoscopes of these criminals. Mars represents sharp instruments, knife, gun, etc., whereas Saturn is the chief governor for longevity; both represent one's end of life. To ruin oneself by squandering away permanent possessions, to lose temporary possessions by theft, and to lose one's charm by suffering from smallpox, etc., are attributed to the evil aspects between Mars and Saturn.

Beneficial Aspects between Mars and Uranus
The native will be resourceful, original, and independent, with intuition and interest in occult subjects. Discovering or inventing this beneficial aspect can be very helpful, as it will allow the native to translate their latent ingenuity and abilities into action, whenever these two planets form favourable aspects either by transit or by progression.

Bad Aspects between Saturn and Mars
The native will become easily angered and, when provoked further, cannot be controlled. Perversion, eccentricity, and doggedness will prevent them from paying heed to other’s suggestions, and they will carry on in their own line of action. They may become stonehearted and wicked, and will fight to the last to establish that they are right, regardless of any material gain. They will stick to their own ideas, even in the face of loss, and will start any business in a flash, which will often end in a crash, followed by disgrace and slander.

Good Aspects of Neptune Make the Native Religious
Success to a satisfactory extent and jubilant spirit are promised. Neptune may make the native take long journeys, have contact with foreigners, have foreign collaboration, and gain much profit in wholesale business, agency, etc.

Bad Aspects Make the Native Perverted in Sexual Life and Frenzied in Religion or Philosophy
The native may have a tendency to poison others or to commit suicide by drowning or taking poison. Otherwise, they may run the risk of being drowned in the sea, river, lake, or well.

Thus, the characteristics of the native are modified by the various aspects received by Mars from the other planets.

Parts of the Body: Mars Governs
Mars governs the external sex organs, muscular system, left ear, face and head, sense of taste, the bladder, nose, uterus, pelvis of kidney, prostate gland, groins, rectum, the colon, the testicles, and red bone marrow.

Disease from which one Suffers when one Runs the Period of Mars
When one runs the period of Mars, who, by its lordship or by occupation, becomes evil, one may suffer from any of the following acute fevers, plague, smallpox, chicken pox, measles, mumps, inflammatory complaints, burns, ruptures of capillaries, fistula, wounds, cuts, brain fever, haemorrhage, typhoid, pueperal fever, ulcer in the intestines, hernia, erysipelas, malaria, abortions, bleeding, boils, carbuncles, appendicites, muscular rheumatism, tumour, septic poisoning, tetanus, etc. To accurately diagnose the aliment and determine its nature requires further deep study, thorough analysis, and correct judgment. Astrology can be useful to the doctor and patient if they are forewarned in advance, as they can take precautionary measures (prophylactic, vaccines, etc.) to protect themselves completely or reduce the virulence of the disease, if it is inevitable to suffer from it.

Profession
As Mars gives one courage and is a militant planet, one may be employed in the military department. Police is also governed by Mars. Those who deal with guns, hunters and gunners may have Mars as the lord of the 2nd, 6th or the 10th house, or Mars may occupy or aspect these houses, or be conjoined with the lords of those houses. Chemists, dentists, surgeons, butchers and barbers are governed by Mars. Those who deal in iron and steel, in the kitchen, in the boilers, steam engines, etc., are under the rule of Mars. It also indicates the smiths industry, factory, dealers in corals, ruby, red articles, thief, robber, dacoit, murder, etc. Mars in the fiery signs shows that one may go to the war front and fight. In earthy signs, it indicates infantry. Mars occupying airy sign denotes air pilots. Watery sign occupied by Mars indicates navy. So also, planets conjoined with Mars or aspecting Mars give clues to find out the exact nature of one's profession. Sun conjoined with Mars indicates that one may be in the accounts or audit department, as Mercury stands for inspection of accounts; military or mechanical engineering is also governed by Mars and Mercury. Venus rules over transport. Saturn indicates that one may be employed in digging trenches, graves, etc., and also to carry the wounded as well as to dispose of the dead.

Products
Iron and steel, coffee, tea, cholam, shellac, tobacco, hemp, walnut, cashew nut, groundnut, betel nut, ginger, pine, mustards, nux vomica, gentiane, garlic, brandy, whisky, arrack, toddy, bhaspum (powders), metallic oxides, pungent articles, axe, knife, sword, gun, etc., copper, wrapon called sataghni, landed properties, serpent, thorny plants, land, building, old materials, old instruments for repairs, and renewal. Mars and Saturn denote iron and steel; Mars and Venus show coffee, tea, etc. Mars and Neptune indicate tobacco; Mars and Moon rule over brandy, whisky, etc. Mars and Rahu or Kethu suggest serpents.

Political: Differences of opinion, disputes, difficulties, misunderstandings, and quarrels among leaders can lead to preparation for war and fighting in the battlefield, restlessness in the state, revolution, violence, murder, rape, loot, bloodshed, arson, kidnapping, etc. Cordite factories manufacture arms and ammunition, bombs, fireworks, tanks, weapons, acids, etc. Reorganisation or expansion of industries producing chemicals, fertilisers, tractors, jeeps, arms, and other death-inflicting weapons, as well as nationalisation of such industries, can lead to drastic laws and reforms, martial law and ordinances, expropriation of foreign capital, expansion of agriculture, reclamation of wastelands, marshy lands, etc. The production and movement of these items can be controlled and restricted by Mars.

Economic: Whenever Mars forms beneficial aspects, there will be great activity and new ventures will be undertaken. In the market, there will be brisk buying and selling, and new companies will be floated. Good aspects at the time of the registration of the company show that it will be sound and profitable, while bad aspects forewarn that the relationship among the directors will not be cordial, leading to misunderstandings and difficulties. Manufacture of motors, engines, spare parts of machines, tools, etc., and the export and import of these are ruled by Mars, as it is called the Boomi Karaka and is a fiery planet. Manufacture of brick, construction of buildings, and quarters for officials and servants are also ruled by Mars. 

Being an impulsive and rash planet, the prices of shares will suddenly have a sharp rise or, if Mars is afflicted by Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune, a precipitous fall. Good aspects give courage to bulls and bad aspects depress them, but give a go-ahead spirit to the bears. There will be strikes by krisans, technicians, mechanics, and subordinates, and as a result, agriculture and industry will be affected. Jupiter and Venus afflicting Mars threaten the cultivators with loss and disappointment, as the agriculture produce will be affected by locusts, pests, rats, etc. There will be an increase in taxes to launch new projects due to war preparations and stockpiling. Purchases of fire engines, expansion of fire extinguishing departments, expansion of vigilance, and A.R.P. are also governed by Mars.

Handwriting: Mars gives sharp angles and narrow hooks. The upper zone is short while the lower zone is long and strong. His words invariably slant towards the right, though very rarely he writes upright. The strokes of his words are thick. He separates his words lavishly, wasting much paper, but not much time. He finds that putting a dot over "i" and drawing a horizontal stroke for "t" are a waste of time. He boldly underlines his signature, which ascends from left to right.

Animals and Birds: Savage Beasts (Tiger, Wolf, Hunting Dogs, etc.), Elephant (according to Brihat Samhita), Vulture, Kite, Hawk, etc.

Plants: Thorny plants, gentian, garlic, marjoram, mustard, hemp, coriander, tobacco, and pine.

Places in India
Mars presides over Narmada, Bheemaratha, Nivindhya, Vetravatee, Godavari, Vena, Ganges, Mahanadhee, Sindhu, Uttara Pandya, near Mount Mahendra, Vindhya, Malaya, Chola, Dravida, Videha, Andhra, Kerala, Asmaka, Bhasapara Kuntalai, Cantipura, Nassik, Bhogavardhana, Tupte, Gomptee, etc.

Places: Warfields, Military Areas, Slaughterhouses, Police Stations, Industrial Areas, Smith Shops, etc.

Time: The two months governed by Mars are referred to as Grisham Ruthu, which are June and July.

Days: Mars Rules Tuesdays
Sundays and Mondays will prove to be days of success, pleasure, and profit. Fridays show pleasure, union, and expense. Wednesdays affect health but increase one's income and improve one's business, and give frequent short journeys. Thursdays are for investment, expansion, and long journeys. Saturdays will be dull and lethargic.

Number: Nine is the number of Mars. One, two, four, and seven are considered auspicious. Three indicates a journey and pleasant purchases. Five is lucky, but health may deteriorate. Six indicates pleasure and expenses. Eight threatens that the native will be lazy and only enjoy success when they become dejected.

Colour: Red is Ruled by Mars

If one is very impulsive or rash, they can use blue so that they can exercise caution and avoid injuries. When selecting a colour, it is important to note the weak points of the native for corrections and improvement. If Mars is very strong and is in a fiery or airy sign, they will be very bold and even rash. For such people, green and blue are the best colours to cool them down and keep them under control. They will not be rash but they will have enthusiasm and practical executive ability.

If Mars indicates one's disease, the astrologer must consider the nature of the ailment and suggest the colour accordingly. If Mars and Moon cause smallpox, red colour should be used for the panes, glass doors, screen cloth, etc. so that the patient will have a rapid cure and they will not appear pox-faced as no scars and pits will be formed due to exposure to red colour. But if Mars and Mercury cause excitement, insanity, or fits, blue and green should be used when they come to normal.

But if one is gloomy, dull, lethargic, and lazy, red should be used; inferiority complex will disappear. They will make fresh attempts and come out successful, even though they had been suffering for a long period due to delay or denial. Red colour offers authority and power; it is useful to overcome dangers and avoid accidents. This is why police stations are red, policemen are supplied with red caps, and fire engines have red paint. Red signals stop one from further proceeding in the same direction at that time, to avoid collision, derailment, and accidents.

All these show that red colour is used to avoid danger, to run no risk, to maintain law and order, and to lead a happy life.

Gems: Coral, Ruby, and All Red Stones Governed by Mars
If one desires to avoid injuries, cuts, burns, scalds, abrasions, to become bold and independent, and to succeed in competition, litigation, etc., they can use red stones.

Advice to Ladies
It is advantageous for ladies to wear red stones, put on red kukum, and use red clothes, etc., because Mars is believed to protect them from the time of birth until the end of life at every stage. For example, in infancy, this protection can help them to have resistance against diseases, not suffer from liver complaints, put on weight, avoid burns, and not dip their hands in boiling milk. In youth, Mars can help them to avoid fire accidents, such as when lighting crackers or standing near stoves. Additionally, Mars can help them to have proper menstruation and not suffer from pains in the breasts or belly. It can also help them to be free from Mars dhosha and have a pleasing partner, and have their marriage celebrated in the proper age without undue delay. Furthermore, Mars can help them to avoid abortions, bleeding, and the need for a surgeon's aid during delivery, as well as to own lands and a house. Additionally, Mars can help them to avoid accidents while going by car or scooter. It can also help them to have a good understanding with their brothers, who can provide help and support, and to be respected by others. Finally, Mars can help them to have no fears and be courageous to maintain health and be ever active until the end of life.

Therefore, ladies should fast on Tuesdays and pray for that deity above. They are recommended to use red gems, cloths, etc., which will give them mental solace. They can be confident that there is no more evil ruled by Mars, etc.
