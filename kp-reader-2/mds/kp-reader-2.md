# Fundamental Principles of Astrology (Hindu, Western & Stellar) - Second Reader

## Letters to the Author
Dear Sir,  
Namaskarams,

I have been interested in learning Astrology and have gone through various Tamil texts written by various authors. I have found it difficult to find definite results or conclusions when a horoscope is taken for analysis and can only obtain rough predictions which mostly fructify adversely.
After I came in contact with your popular magazine ‘Astrology & Athrishta' and became a subscriber of the same, I did not hesitate to obtain your most valuable works 'Krishnamurti Padhdhati', Vols. 1 & 2 and also the 'Table of Houses’ by Raphael for Northern Latitudes.
Your works are of immense value to me and when I went through the pages of the 2nd vol. i.e., pages 166 to 169 regarding scholarship for study for higher education, I was struck with wonder to note the example and analysis. It reminded me to compare and verify with a horoscope which I had just erected with the aid of your works and the Table of Bhavas.
I verified the chart by applying your K.P. and was surprised to find it most accurate in finding the results of past and present occurrences that the native has been experiencing.

Sincerely,  
V. Balakrishanmurthi Chinnasalem


Dear Sir,

Krishnamurthi Padhdhati in Astrology is a great achievement in Indian Astrology and Predictive Stellar Astrology. On the basis of this Padhdhati, the results are one hundred percent correct. ‘Astrology and Athrishta', the monthly magazine, is a gem of an astrological magazine published throughout the world.
I pray to the Goddess Bhadrakali to grant long life to Jyotish Marthand Professor K.S. Krishnamurthi so that he may continue to serve the nation in this great subject.

Thanking you,  
Yours faithfully,   
Professor S.R. Janardhana Rao, B.A.   
Famous Astro-Palmist of India


Dear Brother Krishnamurti, 

I am a student of Astrology and have purchased both volumes of your incredible book, "Krishnamurti Padhdhati". I am reading it carefully and enjoying each chapter. This book is your personal contribution to Astrology and will remain permanent. Your original thinking, deep insight into the subject, and angelic predictions have captivated my imagination.
I had intended to join your classes at Delhi this year, but due to my need to take my M.A. examination for improvement of Division, I was unable to do so.

Sincerely,  
P.N. Saxena  
Warangal


Dear Sir,

It has indeed been my good fortune and proud privilege to have been introduced to you and to have heard your scholarly and entertaining address, spiced with humour. I had previously been misled by a mistaken impression that lecturers on astrology would be dull, drab, and insipid. However, I found your predictions to be interesting and enthusiastic. Your lecture has left a deep and abiding impression, and I wish to become a devoted disciple with no material interest except to gain a working knowledge, if not mastery, of "Krishnamurti Padhdhati".
I am very happy to learn that my friend Swamy has been your student and disciple. Swamy is a gentleman who needs no description. Your association with him might have already revealed to you his sincerity and devotion to his guru. I would consider myself fortunate to meet you at the earliest opportunity. We can benefit from the blessings of elderly and divine people like you.

Thanking you,  
Yours faithfully,  
M.S. Srinivasachary, M.A.


Respected Guruji,

I cannot help but express my admiration for your Padhdhati. I have read many books by various well-known authors, but none have given me the same satisfaction as your work. Your Ayanamsa also gives wonderfully accurate results, which I have tested on numerous known horoscopes to great success.
It is a testament to your greatness that you have not kept your knowledge a secret, but have instead tried to spread it in a clear and scientific manner. I am writing this to express the feelings I have in my mind, though I do not have the words to do it justice. You are truly great and divine grace is at your support.
I would be grateful if you could instruct your office to send me a copy of each of your books whenever they are published.

With kindest regards and best wishes,  
Yours affectionately,  
T.C. Malhan

Respected Sir,  
I began studying astrology in 1960, as I did not have the opportunity to do so earlier. I purchased books on astrology from various authors, totaling Rs.400/-, until 1965. However, I was not satisfied as there were too many rules and each author had different interpretations.
In October 1965, I came into contact with your magazine "Astrology & Athrishta" and purchased your valuable works "Krishnamurthi Padhdhati". I then became a subscriber of your magazine and am now able to cast horoscopes and read out events. However, I feel that I should first receive your "Ashirwad" in order to confidently predict using your system.
Therefore, I would be immensely grateful if you could bless me with a letter of "Ashirwad".
I remain,  

Yours obediently,  
(Sd.) M. Govinda Gowda

## An Interview with the Author

Visitor: Is astrology a science?

I: Why do you doubt it? It is a divine science that reads the divine plan by referring to nature, which is the creation of God.

Visitor: It is not clear.

I: It is a science. Birth and death, pleasure or pain, gain or loss, health and wealth are all experienced according to the divine plan. The only scientific and correct way of understanding the divine plan is by applying the principles of astrology.

Visitor: Is it possible to predict anything and everything?

I: For every science, there are limitations. This is why research is being done to improve existing theories and to supplement them. Efforts are being made to get as close to perfection as possible.

Visitor: Within that limitation, can one predict accurately?

I: Yes. However, the fate of the consultant should also be taken into account. Even if the astrologer is highly knowledgeable, they may still make mistakes and give wrong predictions if the querist is unfortunate at the time of the event.

Visitor: If it is a science, how can predictions go wrong? 

I: Isn't medicine a science? For example, if people suffering from typhoid are admitted to a hospital and all of them have a positive Widal test, the doctor administers the same medicine. Say, one aged 24 and the other 30 die, while the third has a relapse, but the others recover. What do you say? Same science, same disease, same medicine.

Visitor: True

I: Again, don't you know that the great scientists in America are trying to land on the moon? They have been successful on many occasions, but Apollo 13 failed. Why? Is science wrong then? While applying, some mistake must have crept in. Similarly, astrologers may also fail.

Visitor: But most astrologers fail in many predictions. 

I: How do you classify them as astrologers? Because they know the spelling of the sun and moon, or they produce some slokas, or they are born into that family, or they continue to call themselves old, veteran astrologers in spite of their failures? If you approach such people, you will lose faith and call it a pseudo-science.

Visitor: Suppose I want to do something, can astrology help me with that?

I: I told you that our brains have limitations, and science also has its limitations. Within those limits, if you ask the right questions, it can be predicted.

Visitor: Can one correctly predict whether a pregnant mother will have a male or female child?

I: Predictions on natal charts are given taking the moment of birth, which is never changeable. It is only one moment. For example, if a boy is born and later becomes a female, it is impossible to say from the chart whether it belongs to a boy or a girl, as the moment of birth and hence the horoscope remains the same. Similarly, the moment of epoch, which can only be calculated after the birth, is a single moment. If one does research taking the moment of epoch, it also cannot provide any insight. Twins are born at the same time, one boy and one girl, so no method has been found so far. Research is being carried out, but at present there is no science to predict this. It should be discovered. If anyone claims that they can predict, they are bluffing. If you had only contact with them, you would not be entirely wrong in deciding that the science is a pseudo one, but you are correct in saying that the so-called scientist is wrong and you should not overestimate yourself and pass any remarks on the developing science.
Medicine is being developed day by day in leaps and bounds. Even if medicine can be developed to a good extent, it cannot bring back the lives of all the dead. Everywhere there is a limitation.

Visitor: If that is the case, what is the use of astrology?

I: Don't you see every day that people carry the dead from the hospital? When some people are admitted to the hospital and don't walk back home, but are carried away to the cremation ground, are you wise in advising people not to go to the hospital? How many are cured? Does this not depend on their destiny? Similarly, if a few predictions fail, are you to conclude that astrology is not a science? Take the instances where a person expects something, but experiences something else as predicted by the astrologer. The astrologer does not know your affairs as much as you do. He takes only the moment when you meet him or takes a number from you. He is still able to predict correctly. This event, which he predicts, is not expected by you. Then what do you say?

Visitor: It may be a guess.

I: No! A guess comes after knowing the past. Here, he does not know the past. A guess can be the habit of a few astrologers after reading newspapers or knowing the past and present circumstances. If they come up with the correct answer, they jump to conclusions. If they fail, they offer lame excuses. They never take the time to determine whether the method they follow is universally applicable. Even when they know that it is only correct in a few cases and fails miserably in many, they have no other choice. They have to make a living; their business has to go on. Such astrologers, without opening the eyes of others or simply throwing dust in their eyes, apply general principles and carry on their living; it appears as though they do not take the time to find out what happened to the predictions they offered, but presume that they will come true; or they don't care whether it proves correct or not; or they probably know that if it is correct, then all is well; if not, the world is wide.
Only such astrologers bring ridicule to the divine science without bringing to the attention of the queriers the limitations.

Visitor: Why shouldn't they speak out as you do?

I: I know my limitations. I openly say, I don't care what others think of me. Speak the truth. Be honest. Acknowledge your limitations. Where you can be very precise, state the result. Where you can't, as the science has not developed to that extent, don't take the subject; acknowledge your limitations.

Visitor: I agree. I see no use in dabbling in subjects for which there are no specific, clear-cut, and exhaustive rules. I want to do research on natal charts for the rest of my life and find truths that are useful to each individual, to find out all matters connected with them and how they fit into modern living conditions. What is the point of wasting time trying to find out "how many wicks were in the lamp when one's mother delivered; how many attendants were there at the time of delivery," and so on?

Visitor: So, you restrict your research to natal horoscopes alone?

I: Yes. Don't you know that astrology has many branches? I want to serve the masses, so I do this research. It is advisable that every doctor specializes in some branch of medical science; a few brain specialists, a few opticians, a few dentists, a few E.N.T., and so on. Similarly, in engineering, a few mechanical, a few electrical, a few sanitary, and so on. Hence, one can't underestimate the other. Each can develop in any one branch. One can't judge the ability of the other. So let me continue my research.

Visitor: Why can't you take up politics?

I: This branch of science is still in its infancy. In my lifetime, I want to complete my research on natal charts before taking up Mundane Astrology.

Visitor: Don't you think you can offer thrilling predictions and, if by chance any of these come true, you will become popular?

I: Yes, yes. Failures will likely outnumber successes as it is not yet perfected. So the same attempt will bring ridicule and shame. Why should I take the risk or guess and be a laughingstock in the market?

Visitor: If I ask you to use the available scientific rules to make a prediction, what would be the accuracy of the prediction?

I: When science is incomplete and imperfect, the results can be incorrect. My prediction will be correct if the person in question has a good time, but it will fail if the event predicted does not occur during the querist's unfortunate period. Many people give wrong times of birth, and some don't even know their date of birth. These people often hold high positions, and different people cast and discuss various charts. These people are not advancing the science by researching correct charts; they are taking a chance. However, I choose charts after verifying their accuracy.

Visitor: Don't you have any method by which you can predict events to someone who doesn't have a horoscope?

I: It was for that purpose that I did research on Horary Astrology and I have come very close to offering 100% accurate results.

Visitor: Have you published any books on this subject?

I: Yes, it is ready. By applying the horary system, I can predict.

Visitor: Why can't you do it?

I: It is being done and it helps them take advantage of the opportunity.

Visitor: Suppose I ask how long a politician will live? 

I: First of all, I am not concerned with who rules, whether it be X or Y, or how long they will remain in power. If I must give an answer to please you, I will do so, but only for your sake.

Visitor: Have you ever predicted correctly?

I: I do not believe in predicting that X will have a difficult time in any year. However, I do give dates. I have been very accurate in the cases of the late Jawaharlal Nehru, the late Mr. Lal Bahadur Shastri, the resignation of Mr. T.T.K., and a few more.

Visitor: Why shouldn't you publish beforehand?

I: As I told you, I am not interested in their longevity. Secondly, since a third person puts the query and I answer him because I have to please him with a correct prediction. Why should I publish and incur the displeasure of the person concerned? I do not want the friendship of such people nor enmity. My prediction may be interpreted in any way. So, my caravan will go on doing research work and finding some truth for the benefit of the people rather than to benefit myself with such cheap popularity and use astrology for my pot-boiling. I work to improve the science and make it a reliable science.

## ASTROLOGY - AN OCCULT SCIENCE

Astrology is a noble science; it is as old as the Vedas. It depends on the position of the planets, which is ascertained astronomically, and explains the celestial phenomena and corresponding terrestrial events. The true meaning of astrology is the "Message of the Stars". By using the salient principles of astrology, depending on the position of the planets ascertained astronomically, one can forecast events for the benefit of all, and as such, it is a useful science for interpreting nature. 

"Astronomy is excellent; but it must come up into life to have its full value and not remain there as globes and spaces" - Emerson. 

The whole world is run according to a well-defined plan; nothing happens by chance. Astrology does not permit one to classify anything as an accident, as it explains the cause and effect of events. The divine plan is well arranged and timed with amazing precision. 

Some say that astrology is an art, while others reject it as an idle dream or an illusion. Still others may speak of astrology as though it were an altogether contemptible superstition, and they contemplate with pity those who believe in it. Some of those who have no disappointment or other difficulties in life take pride in saying that they have no faith in astrology and ridicule both the astrologer and the science. Probably they may fear that they may lose their self-importance if they were to recognize astrology. A few others, under wrong impression or with prejudiced ideas, say that astrology is not a science. These people would not have mastered the data on which correct predictions are based. 

Pretending to know everything, they display their ignorance. The antagonists often quote the opinions of such learned men, who do not want to admit that it is a useful science. Learning is the mechanical acquisition of facts and gaining knowledge in any subject, but wisdom is not so. Astrology can be correctly interpreted only by a person endowed with divine grace, and none can call themselves learned without knowing astrology. 

A great theosophist, Mr. Chidambaram Iyer, says that nothing can be more funny than to find young men, especially, taking up astrology as their first subject of attack in their public utterances. It is a subject to which they pay little or no attention except for purposes of ridicule. In my experience, I find a few elderly members behaving worse than such youngsters. 

I submit that astrology is a science and that it can render very useful service to one and all, and create faith even in the sceptic, if one studies this textbook. A knowledge about the history of astrology and the illustrious and eminent sages and savants who practiced astrology would give a better appreciation of the science itself.

## HISTORY OF ASTROLOGY

The history of astrology begins with creation itself. Sage Garga says that the science was propounded by the Creator Himself and that Brahma handed it down to him at the time of creation. From Garga, other sages got it and it spread all over. It appears to be coeval with that of the Earth. In Western countries, there is a certain belief that Seth (3769 B.C.) was the world's first astrologer. This can be inferred from the astrological books written later by Arabic, Egyptian, Jewish, and Persian writers. Westerners believe that Seth was the first person to study the planets, their motions, and their pathways. It is he who divided the zodiac into twelve equal parts, as he found that the Sun ever follows a particular path in the heavens year after year; he also noticed that this circular route of the Sun was spaced out by twelve full moons, which occur once a month. Therefore, the Sun's path is divided into twelve equal parts called "Mazzaroth," which term we designate as "signs," rasis, or solar mansions.
Around 2600 years ago, the priests and the shepherds of Chaldea took this science for serious study and developed it. Their period was called the Golden Age of Astrology, because they connected the movements of the planets with all kinds of events in human life. Dr. Thompson says that the Akkadians and the Sumerians observed the heavens and heavenly bodies and tried to note their courses. The Babylonians and the Egyptians attributed some influence over the animate and inanimate objects on the Earth. Astrology was popular and it wielded great influence over the rich, the priests, the princes, and the kings. Mespero said that, in his time, the mistress of the world was astrology.
Some are of the opinion that astrology had its origin in Chaldea from time immemorial. They suggest that the very name Chaldean means "astrologer." The Pythagoreans further advanced the concepts of the Chaldeans. They applied higher mathematics. Later, astrology came into the hands of the Greeks. They concentrated more on natal astrology, as they had a deep-rooted religious nature and an enquiring mind. They always posed the questions, "Who am I? Why am I born? What for do I live? Why are there so much of inequalities in life?" They had the answers only through astrology.
Many of the records of the early astrologers of Nineveh and Babylon are found among the early tablets in the British Museum. Some of their findings are dated nearly 5000 years ago. The Greeks were also enthusiastic in following astrology. They erected the horoscope for the time of birth and presaged the finance, family, fate, fortune, and future of the individuals. One of the Greek horoscopes written in papyrus about 2000 years ago is kept in the British Museum. The Chaldeans who practiced this art of astrology were held in high esteem even at the time of Alexander the Great.
The Egyptians were equally interested in astrology, which played an important role. They were also responsible for shaping the future of the nation. As can be seen from the monuments, the inscriptions, and modern investigations, this science dates back to 5000 B.C. The Pharaohs gave much respect to the astrologers of whom Babilus was the leader. He was always consulted and the duty of Babilus was to find out the charts of those who might perchance gain power, become a rival, and create trouble to the emperor. Whenever Babilus foresaw any such native, he informed the king, who put such people to death. Pharaohs had faith in their astrologers. Often they were consulted to interpret the dreams of the king.
In Persia, the kings honored the astrologer for their sound knowledge of this science. It is only Gjamasp, otherwise known as "Al Hakim" (meaning "learned"), an astrologer in the Persian court, who precisely predicted the time of birth of the Prophets. The Saracens spread the science in Spain in 711 A.D. and the North Africans, the Moors, in 1237, carried the science to Europe.
Dr. Brewster admits that in China about 2752 B.C., from the days of King Fohi, they developed astronomy solely for studying astrology; and emperors were chosen according to the profound knowledge possessed by them in astrology. In 2513 B.C., Cheuni was elected as the king in that manner. Whenever Alexander the Great went out, he took with him the astronomer Calisthenis in all his fifteen campaigns. He spread the science in the East by giving out some of the rational methods adopted there, and his visit to India had helped him to learn more and develop it further in his country.
Henry Cornelius Agrippa, born in 1486, was the astrologer to Francis I of France when he was 38 years old. John Dee was the favorite astrologer of Queen Elizabeth. Abu Mezar of Bulah was the professor of mundane astrology at Bagdad. The Caliph Mammonarmsheed translated many ancient astrological works into Arabic.
Thus, every nation is to be credited with the knowledge of this science. It is advisable to learn the experiences and findings of research workers who have contributed to the technique of correct prediction. Let me mention the names of a few foreigners who have contributed to the development of this science. They were not only scholars in astrology but were renowned and reputed astronomers, historians, philosophers, physicians, and poets.
Astronomers: Ptolemy (67 A.D.), Galileo, Newton, Pythagoras, Kepler (27-12-1571), Copernicus.
Astrologers: Alan Leo, Sepharial, Dr. W.J. Llewallyn, Hayden, George, Agrippa Simmonite, Max Heindel, Carter, Parter, Morirus, Maurice, Sibley, Wemyss, W. Lily, Culpeter, Boreham, Robson, Newton.
Historians: Diodorus, Coley, Pabwal, Maximus, Josephus, Plutarch, Camden, Herodotus.
Philosophers: Lilly, Macrobius, Aristotle, Bacon, Thales, Pliny, Anasagoros, Ptolemy.
Physicians: Hypocrates, Foster, John Dee, Gilbert, Partridge, Agrippa, Starkey.
Poets: Hypocrates, Foster, Galen, John Dee, Gilbert, Partridge, Agrippa.

In India, it is said that the sage Garga handed down the science of astrology to his disciples. There are recorded evidences that the Yavanas were very learned astrologers and that they lived many centuries before Varahamihira, who admired the progress made by the Yavanas in this science in his textbooks. Yavanas have contributed much to the development of this science in India. Records show that around 3102 B.C. the Tirvalore Tables were used solely for astrological purposes. The following list furnishes the names of a few renowned Indian scholars who expounded, explained, and interpreted this science: Garga, Viddha Garga, Asite, Aryabhatta, Bhrigu, Brihaspathi, Badarayana, Baradwaja, Bhadalla, Devaswami, Devala, Dravyavardhana, Garutman, Jeevasaman, Kapila, Kanabuk, Kashyappa, Latacharya, Manu, Manitha, Maya, Parasara, Panlisa Pitamaha-Romaka, Rishiputa, Sidhasena, Simhacharya, Saka, Saptharishi, Saraswatha, Savitra, Satyacharya, Yavanacharya, Varahamihira, Bathothpala, Prithyuyasas, Vaidyanatha Dikshithar, and many others. Thus, it can be seen that astrology was held in great esteem in all ages by the leaders in other sciences as well.

As years passed by, for various reasons, this science, which is sure to live long, has lost some of its charms. But science remains ever a science. In every age, a particular science alone receives much attention and is developed, even though every science has its own innate value and is useful to us. No country has ever passed without any advancement in any branch of science. So, in every age, one science may be very popular, whereas the other sciences may be ignored, though not totally forgotten. It is not unlikely that there are people even now whose names would come as a great surprise to all; there will be very earnest and loyal students of astrology who will popularize astrology.

This book is published with the sincere desire that astrology should be made popular. Much research is done regularly and systematically, and further research has to be carried out. There should be fool-proof methods to read accurate results. Students of astrology with half-baked knowledge should be educated and imparted higher knowledge. Their doubts should be cleared. Those who bring ridicule to this noble science should be silenced by producing able astrologers who will give correct knowledge to them. It is only with correct and clear understanding of the subject that one can predict astoundingly accurate results, and establish that the noble legacy, astrology, given to us by our forefathers, is indeed a science which is as accurate as any other science. The present position of astrology, in the hands of a number of astrologers, is really deplorable. The excuse may be that there is no proper education for them and hence the result is unsatisfactory. Even when watches are manufactured by one concern, no two watches agree. If they are manufactured by many, one can guess how they will be. Similarly, astrologers and a few other professionals usually offer different opinions, confusing the already depressed consultant. So, I suggest that coaching up of students is absolutely necessary to have the same school of thought. To say that it is not a fit subject cannot be said as a wise statement from the astrologer's point of view.

In many other countries, astrology is included in the curriculum. It is understood that in American universities, astrology is included. Also, there are schools of astrology in Germany, Switzerland, Holland, and France. Now, in India, in Jaipur, astrology is included. KULAPATIJI Dr. MUNSHI is conducting courses on astrology in Delhi and Madras, where I coach up students, and in Bombay, learned scholars with vast experience teach. Scientific circles there give serious attention to it. Astrologers are today thankful to the Astrological Research Association of New York, which publishes a quarterly (Editor: Charles Jayne), and all research scholars are allowed to contribute their articles. At present, in India, astrology is like a TB patient left uncared for, especially by those who alone can cure. It is handled by a few. Of them, some are avaricious, some have commercialized it by fortunetelling without the desire to maintain the prestige and utility of astrology. Some alone sacrifice everything for this noble science. The rash and worthless predictions of a few astrologers have debased astrology and these are received with a sarcastic smile only to be dismissed.

## Nadis
People feel sorry that they consulted "Nadis" written on palmyra leaves, which are claimed to be written by the ancient Rishis of India. It is a fact that the events in the lives of many people born and yet to be born are found written already by Hindu geniuses. People who have consulted them add that they are dumbfounded with the surprisingly accurate happenings of the past events, but feel upset when the future predictions fall miserably. This is a common complaint. Thousands of years ago, Rishis wrote these wonderful predictions. 
Why can they be very correct in all the predictions from the time of birth of the native till the date of consultation, yet fail in their future predictions? This needs proper investigation, as there are a large number of genuine Nadis and it is likely that a few may be unauthentic ones. 
The solution can be found easily if the palm leaves are handed over to the consultants by the owners, who hold the leaves and read out the results, as if from them. If the reading of the past and present agree correctly, the future must also be invariably correct when the Nadi can claim to be one of the genuine documents. Our sages who wrote Nadis can never fail in their predictions and they have never failed, due to their intuitive power and scientific knowledge.
It is not unlikely that a few readers of the palm leaves gain enough knowledge and experience to recite verses, composed by themselves in no time. 
A few of them, when they read the past events, have to read very strictly the material as it is found in the leaves, because the past has to be correct. Then only, the consultant will hear them further. But when the future is to be read, it is open to doubt as to whether they read only those materials found on the leaves or they themselves coin verses suiting the taste of the querist.
In one case, a consultant and his friend caught a fraud, the Nadi reader, red-handed, because he had Mahabaratham on hand and read his life by having those leaves on hand, looking at them and turning over pages after pages every 5 minutes. 
Another experience at Benares was also published in the magazine Astrology and Athrishta. It is a pity that the existence of a few such people bring ridicule to this amazing Nadi.
Another investigation is also to be made to find out whether the documents are genuine and original. 
There is the doubt whether the authors, i.e. the sages, knew all languages including Tamil, etc., in South India, as they lived in the North having Sanskrit as the Mother tongue and Nadis are found in all languages. Also, whether they used paper and pen as some Nadis are found written in paper and claimed to be original. 
Whatever it is, there are records now to prove that astrology was practiced by many people thousands of years ago who could predict even the birth time of a native in the 20th century, the place of his birth, names of his parents, occupations, etc., and the events in his life; marriage, profession, foreign journey, property, conveyance, etc. They had such profound knowledge. 
Now it has deteriorated to a great extent, like a multi-millionaire having a few hundreds in the bank. It is more or less in a pitiable condition in India.
In fact, there is probably not one science which is not properly understood, which so many pretend to know, and on which so many are prepared to express an opinion as in the case of astrology.
Westerners are always research-minded. If they find any truth in any statement and if they are convinced, they study it further and develop it. It may be that there are failures. Yet they consider how it is possible to predict correctly in some cases, and why in other cases there is failure; and to find out the truth they make research until something satisfactory is discovered.
Egyptians were observing the stars for more than 473,000 years. So says Diodorus in his writings in 30 B.C. and they still continue to observe, record and further improve their knowledge in Astronomy, which is the complement of the other science, Astrology.
I have, so far, been briefly stating the fate of astrology in India and in other countries from the time of Creation till today.

## Astrology - available data incomplete
Astrology today is incomplete and needs to be vastly supplemented. No one is in possession of all the findings of our sages; nor are we blessed with such a Guru who can impart correct scientific knowledge to us. Whatever we may have today is only a part of what they have left behind. A subject taught by a professor will be complete. We are not fortunate to have such an advantage in our lifetime. So with what little literature we possess, we have to understand the fundamental principles and then, by regular and strenuous work, develop it.
Another disadvantage is that in India there are many languages and the subjects were written mostly in verses. The first difficulty is to translate them correctly into the respective languages and get them printed. Hence all the books that are printed in Tamil are not found in Gujarati, Marathi, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada or Malayalam. Some books in Gujarati are not available in Tamil; nor are they heard of by Tamils.
In each language, only new books are produced. Many are left out due to various reasons, the main one being the cost of printing and the lack of satisfactory encouragement from any source. Hence the ancient literature available in each place is incomplete like a torn-out dictionary. It is a part of the whole. This is one of the main reasons why we feel the need to have a study circle and do research.
When we hear complaints from astrological-minded people, we find that they do not ridicule the science of astrology but only those astrologers whom they consulted. The main reason for the failure of most of the astrologers is due to the defects in their methods of interpretation and their incapacity to satisfy the qualifications prescribed by Varahamihira.

## Qualifications of an astrologer
The sage says that an astrologer should come from a noble family, should be attractive, have a temperate disposition, be honest, impartial, and have a good physique. They should be active and courageous, articulate, witty, sincere, and free from vices, with no stage-fright. They should worship Devas, observe fasts and penance, and be knowledgeable in astronomy and astrology, including the five schools of thought in India: Paulisa, Romaka Siddhanta, Vasishta, Saura, and Paitamaha. The astrologer should be familiar with all the Siddhantas and be able to understand objections and points of difference. The sage assures that when an astrologer has thoroughly understood the mathematical portion and has acquired the sound principles of astrology, their predictions and teachings will never fail. He asks, "How could one who has not understood the spirit of the Sastras be called an astrologer?" and adds that they are only a fool whose interpretation is just opposite to the principles expounded by the sages and who makes mistakes in their calculations. Varahamihira admits, "It is easy for anybody to cross a sea if the breeze is favourable, but it is not possible for a person who is not a sailor to reach the other shore of the ocean of astrology". Varahamihira opines that even sages in forests, free from domestic worry, pride, and prejudice, welcome the astrologer and without hesitation take interest in astrology when they, by chance, meet a wise astrologer.

## Advice to the Administrator
He advised the Kings that just as the night does not shine without a lamp and the sky without the Sun, so also the King cannot have a smooth life without proper guidance. He warned that the Kings will have pitfalls, like a blind pedestrian, if he has no astrologer to guide him properly, well in advance.
Varahamihira reiterated thus: "Therefore, a King who desires to maintain fame and enjoy an all-round success must engage the services of a few leading astrologers who are not only versatile but also clever, well-versed, and skilled in this science of prognostication".
He turned to the people of the nation and went to the extent of saying, "One who is longing for peace and prosperity should avoid living in a place where no astrologer is available" even as Owaiyar said, "Don't live in a place where there is no temple".
Varahamihira feared that a King who does not patronize such astrologers, who satisfy these qualifications, will surely come to grief and will be denied mental solace.
Varahamihira encouraged and cheered up such astrologers saying that no man or woman who studies the science of astrology and divines the course of destiny will be seen in Hell. In this world, by Hell we mean worry, anxiety, disharmony, depression, disappointment, and no ray of hope for redemption. After death, none knows what Hell is. It may be a rebirth to suffer further. Thus, astrology does contribute beneficial effects to one and all, including the astrologer: in whichever caste or creed the astrologer may be born, it does not matter, he is honored.
Varahimihira said that the Yavanas were of low birth. When astrology had come to stay with them, they were adored. Even now, if astrologers of their standard were available, they will be honored as astrologers, and they can gain much influence and render real assistance to all those who approach them, even as a river in space can quench the thirst of the human beings, animals, birds, aquatics, plants, trees, etc. But a quack is like a deep and dangerous river, putting an end to the life of one by wetting the banks, dragging him to the depth, immersing him to the bottom, keeping him there itself for some time, and finally lifting him up to float, dead.

## Astrology its use and limitations
Astrology is a highly respected science; no other method of divination is worthy of mention. Its use can provide mental strength to the weak-minded, solace to the depressed, peace to the anxious, and steadiness to those who are wavering or vacillating in mind. It can help one to reconcile to difficult situations, and to be level-headed under any circumstances. It can also prompt one to render help to those in need, banish evil thoughts, and make efforts to lead a simple, honest, and pious life.

## Karma is the cause of inequality in life. 
The only thing that is distributed fairly in every land is worry. Rich or poor, man or woman, every individual has their allotted quota of worry. Everyone wants peace of mind, but nobody gets it. Let us consider a few types of curses or ill-fate and how each one is worried.
A rich landlord secures tons of rice at every harvest, but is unable to take a bowl of cooked rice as he suffers from diabetes. He curses his fate. He who runs a group of high-class hotels caters delicious food of all varieties to his customers, but he cannot consume even a bit of it himself since he suffers from blood pressure or colic pains.
An emaciated and thin-looking person with an income barely sufficient for the maintenance of two adults is blessed with enough children to form a cricket team of his own, while a very well-to-do neighbour in the best of health has none and the latter is depressed and does not know when they can have one.
A supremely intelligent person, who had been scoring top marks in school, is forced by circumstances to serve in later life under one who is extremely dull-witted and is looked upon as a symbol of backwardness. The intelligent person earns a meagre income and carries out the orders of the dull-witted. They worry when they can have bright days.
A young girl with no grace or charm gets married, but her neighbour who is very beautiful and rich with all the required qualifications for marriage, continues to be on the waiting list, forlorn and unhappy, in spite of serious attempts by relatives and friends. They would be in peace if they were informed by the astrologer of her destiny and when they can fulfill their desire.
Thus, it is observed that every person has their share of trials and tribulations in life. If there is one science that lifts the load off one's mind and enables them to face the future with confidence and hope, it is astrology. The science of astrology alone explains why everyone has some worry or other and also why there is so much inequality in life and offers mental solace. The fundamental basis of astrology is Karma and Re-incarnation.
The whole world is a huge theatre. The cinema of life goes on forever. Every individual is an actor. The past, the present, and the future are already fixed in the roll of the films. The future will be shown in the same order without any alteration, and we enjoy or suffer as time passes on without any modification. The roll of film already taken is according to the Karma done by us in the previous birth and the story is the result in this birth and it cannot be changed.
Karma is a Sanskrit word, "Kri" meaning ‘action’ or 'deed'. Any mental or physical action is called Karma; every action produces its reaction or result which is known as Karma. Thus, Karma includes both the action and the result governed by the irresistible law of 'Causation’.
So, under the law of Karma, there is nothing as chance or an accident. The so-called chances and accidents are really the products of some definite causes which we may not be aware of beforehand. That which appears to be accidental or providential to a non-astrological mind is a natural and inevitable incident to an astrologer. Hence, chances, luck or misfortune are governed absolutely by the law of Causation or Karma. God is neither partial nor unjust, and everything happens according to one's action in the previous birth. Man is completely a puppet in the hands of certain higher agencies. Karma and re-incarnation are like a seed growing into a tree which bears fruits yielding seeds which in turn produce more trees. The seed is the Karma. The growth of the tree is the life.
As is the seed, so will be the plant that springs out of it. If one sows paddy, one cannot get wheat. When one sows orange one cannot get apple. Everyone creates their own destiny. One should realise that, it is because of their own Karma, they suffer. The doctrine of Karma alone explains and reconciles people to the terrible and apparent injustice of life. The knowledge prevents them from cursing life or fellow beings or God. 
Only the divine of Karma can explain why people suffer, although they might not have done anything wrong in this life, and they may explain that the stars are bad and that they do not deserve any kind of trouble. Most of us believe that the planets do not cause luck or ill luck. They only indicate the trend of events in our life. The cause is our Karma. It fructifies by the will of God. Without our previous Karma, God who loves us all, who is just and impartial, will not give different results to the people who are His children, or cause troubles to them. You can compare God to rain water which is pure. Rain water enables the seeds to sprout and grow. But some alone thrive, and some die out. This is due to the inherent potency of the seeds. 
Astrology explains what Karma one should have done in the previous birth and what they should experience in this birth and when.
A surveyor can say that the rain in Mercara will take the course of the river Cauvery and that in Rishikesh will take the course of the Ganges. These courses are earmarked. So also, astrology can offer predictions and also classify those who will try to mitigate the afflictions or augment one's luck and who will not make any attempt at all. Every event will take them by surprise.

## Fate is inevitable.
Destiny is thus the inevitable and unavoidable occurrence of events in one's life which is not all under the control of the person but is directed by the Almighty according to His Original Judgment passed on the consideration of the Karma done by the person in the previous birth which is known only to His Almighty. It can be predicted by a wise astrologer. The belief that one can modify or nullify the results of Destiny by exercising his will is not correct.

Natal astrology as propounded by the ancient sages is a convincing science, having its foundations of Karma theory; it should be possible for the astrologer who interprets it, to read out from the chart, the circumstances under which one is placed, his normal expectations, whether one will make attempts to hoodwink destiny and ultimately the nature of the result and the time of event. It is only when the knowledge of astrology gained by one is limited and the interpreter is not fully aware of Karma theory, he gives, importance to self-will and offers advice; he later understands that the native followed his suggestions and ultimately he enjoyed desirable results. He attributes all these to self-will. But he does not realise that what he predicted was incomplete. He has not properly under-stood the present, the circumstances under which one will be placed, what attempts one will make to alter it by exercising one's will and the ultimate result. Actually everything is found in the horoscope. Attributing to self-well is no thing but attachment of importance to one's will and one's own self. Astrology clearly shows that man is postulated as the subject of a certain destiny and human endeavour as the fulfilling of fate. It may be said, more as a compromise, that man is both a slave of the effects of his past deeds and is a free agent as regards his deeds which are in no way directed to thwart, arrest, alter or in any way modify or remould the effects of his past Karma. The past, the present and the future are all recorded as explained previously in the cine film. The stars and the planets in their course denote our destinies, not only those fulfilled in the past but also those lying stored up for us in the future.

Able astrologers who have specialized in any branch of the science can boldly declare an event without doubt and can go to the extent of taking a challenge that a particular result must happen, mentioning also the time of the event. The following few remarkable examples will convince the readers. 

King Vikramathithya had many astrologers in his court. Of them, Mihira was an intellectual giant and the most renowned. He was admired and held in great reverence, not only by Vikramathithya but also by his colleagues and the general public. The King had a son. Mihira cast the horoscope of the Prince. Other astrologers also prepared the boy's horoscope using different systems of calculation-Nirayana, Drik Ganitha, etc. Kalidas and Vararuchi were in favour of the author of Panchasiddantika and hence followed Siddhanta or Nirayana. 

Whichever system others followed, all of them gave their opinion that the Prince would have an anxious time at the age of 18. On the nature of the danger and the cause of death of the Prince, they were not unanimous. Others were of the opinion that his Prince might lose his life due to the injuries inflicted by an animal while hunting. But the most learned and wise Varahamihira who enjoyed the blessing of Lord Adhitya, and had Divya Drishti and Vaksiddhi predicted clearly and boldly that the prince would be killed by a Varaha, i.e, a boar at a particular hour on a particular date. He also said that no human remedies could avert the danger and save him from the jaws of death and that this unpleasant incident could not be altered. He said "AVASYAM ANUBOKTHAVYAM KRITHAM KARMA SUBHASUBHAM", that the Prince could not survive even if all the precautions were taken. 

Years passed. The Prince was maintaining robust health. His surroundings were well guarded even some months prior to the eventful day. On the morning of the fateful day, the King held a Durbar. A huge crowd was anxiously awaiting. The king requested Varahmihira to verify his calculations and confirm whether the fateful hour would be the same 5-00 p.m. on that day as predicted previously. All had their own doubts, because very precaution was taken by the King. No wild boar or wild animal could have any chance of gaining access to the Prince's palace which was very well protected by a huge army of vigilant warriors. 

The Prince was asked to take his seat in the seventh floor, and all the staircases were fully guarded. The King was confident that his son was safe. So he asked Varahamihira how could his son die from injuries, inflicted by a boar, when none would be allowed into the palace and especially when no animal could enter at all. He again requested him to reconsider deeply about his original prediction. The King also declared that he would award the Emblem of the Royal Title 'Varaha' to Mihira, if the prediction would prove to be true because the King wanted to honour this science. 

Some minutes passed. Absolute silence prevailed. The whole crowd was eagerly observing Mihira to hear his verdict. Varahamihira said that he was devoted to Sun God and he is blessed with Vak Siddhi. No mistakes could be committed. Death from the injuries inflicted by a boar was predicted from the Prince's horoscope without any shadow of doubt. That was the penalty announced by the planets in the chart according to Karma done by the Prince in his previous birth. He repeated that the results of the past cruel Karma speak out through the planetary position of the time of birth. Therefore one should be prepared for the worst in spite of all possible efforts made to hoodwink Destiny. 

People, who gathered there, were confident that nothing could happen in such strictly guarded palace. At frequent intervals a warrior was asked to give information about the Prince's health. Reports that he was hale and healthy were received all right regularly. At 5 p.m. one warrior reported that the Prince was all right and the place was peaceful. Sometime later another soldier brought the same news. But Varahamihira did not agree. He calmly said to the King that the Prince had died at the stipulated time and it would be advisable if they would verify. The King kept quiet. Another soldier, after some time, came to the assembly and told that the place was calm and there was no disturbance at all. 

The King began to doubt the prediction, and again said to Mihira whether there could be any mistake in his calculation. Mihira reiterated that he was dead at the moment he predicted. He further mentioned boldly that the Prince was lying dead in a pool of blood; probably the watchman and the companions might not have noticed it. He suggested and persuaded the King to go and see for himself. The King with some important officers went up the stairs, one after another. The King reached the 7th floor. The companions of the Prince were deeply absorbed in playing games and did not notice the arrival of the King. One enquiry the King understood that the Prince had been playing with them all along and that only a little while ago, he had gone out to the adjacent open terrace. 

All quickly stepped into the open terrace. Oh God! What a horror! To their great grief, the Prince was lying dead in a pool of blood. They found that his body was injured by the front claw of an artificial boar. Thus God's will, according to the Karma of the Prince, fructified, as indicated by the planets, without being averted by the efforts of the King and his subjects. Therefore all events in our life are actually beyond our control and we have to submit ourselves quietly and suffer the consequences of our previous Karma. 

When the place was constructed, the architect erected a flagstaff and fixed an artificial boar made of iron and mortar at the top of the palace eyes_as all the towers in his kingdom had this Royal Emblem. To none, it struck that this artificial boar might be the cause of the death. The Prince just before 5.00 p.m. felt uneasy. He went to the open terrace to have fresh air. Exactly at 5.00 p.m. a strong wind broke the post into two and the Boar fell down. It fell straight on the chest of the Prince. The injury was so deep that the terrible loss of blood resulted in his immediate collapse.

The prediction of the Soothsayer given to Julius Caesar warning him that on the 15th of March there was danger to his life, as the Ides of March were there, proved to be correct. Julius Caesar could have avoided it by staying at home. However, this evil incident, which was to happen, induced Brutus to persuade Caesar and take him to the Senate. God gave Caesar one more chance to pay respect to the prediction. On the way, Caesar again met the Soothsayer who had previously predicted the danger. Caesar said to him, "The Ides of March are come," i.e., the 15th of March had arrived and the prediction had not come true. The Soothsayer calmly and with confidence replied, "Ay, Caesar, but not gone," i.e., the 15th of March was not yet over. In a few hours, Caesar was killed by Brutus and his end could not be prevented by anyone's will or action; the stars gave a correct indication to non-believers.

Ptolemy said, "Whosoever may be adopted to any particular event or pursuit will assuredly have the star indicative thereof very potent in his nativity."
The Emperor Pareekshit went to the forest and, after hunting, was feeling very tired and thirsty. He entered the ashram of Angira's Rishi, but was not immediately honored and attended to. He lost his temper and placed the dead skin of a snake around the Rishi's neck before returning home. This was later discovered by the Rishi's son, who cursed - or rather predicted - that the person who committed this folly would die on the seventh day by snake bite. The King heard of this curse and tried to avoid it, but despite his prayers to Lord Krishna, spending all the hours of the day listening to the Bhagavatam, shifting his place of residence, and taking all care, he could not outlive the time predicted. Taksaka, the King of the Snakes, bit him and thus ended the life of the Emperor Pareekshit, as told by the son of the sage.
This example is given to show that, even after knowing the nature and time of the event, however mighty one may be, they cannot alter it. As Dryden said, "Whatever betides, by Destiny it is done: And better bear like men than vainly seek to shun." One may try to commit suicide, yet they will survive if this end is not indicated by their birth chart.
One person was very unfortunate and married an arrogant, adamant, and atrocious wife who was always argumentative, aggressive, and avaricious. He found it impossible to get on with her and decided to commit suicide. He went to the sea to end his life, but was a good swimmer and thought that the waves might carry him to the shore or he himself could swim and save his life. He walked along the beach and found a big tree very near the sea in an unfrequented place. He took a long rope, climbed up the tree, and tied the rope to the branch that was overhanging the sea. While making a loop at the other end, he thought that he would suffer much when the rope would throttle his neck, so he returned home, took some intoxicating drug to deaden the pain. Again, a doubt arose whether he would die or survive, so he became bold, took a revolver, loaded it, and walked straight to the tree. He adjusted the rope, put on the loop, gave a kick to the branch of the tree, and straight down he fell. While falling, he fired, but because of the jerk he missed the aim and the bullet severed the rope instead of hitting his forehead. He plunged into the sea and went so deep that he swallowed a few mouthfuls of the brackish sea water, which brought out the intoxicating poison. He swam and the sea carried him to the shore, and he became wiser than before. Look! He tried to hang himself, get drowned in the sea, poison himself to die, and also used his revolver, yet he escaped from all these methods of committing suicide. Why? Because he had to live in this world until his end came according to Prarabdha, i.e., Destiny.

There is a catalogue of recent instances that I have accurately predicted. A few of them are given here: (a) luck; (b) longevity; (c) accident; (d) marriage; (e) incapability to go against destiny. I predicted that a high official would gain a lump sum for a very small stake in races on 8-5-1955. The native never used to go to the races, but he was persuaded by his friend who had no knowledge about this prediction and was taken by him. The officer was witnessing and enjoying the races all the time. He who took him, without informing the officer, purchased a few sweep tickets and gave one to the officer who reluctantly accepted it and paid its value Rs. 2/-. The event was over and the officer got the first prize of Rs. 4,200/-.

A well-known physician of Madras was ill and the medical experts who attended on him on 6-2-58 gave up hope. His sons, in their anxiety, consulted me. I gave in writing that upon 26-6-58 their father would have indifferent health; in May 1958 his health would be normal and there would be a happy celebration in the family; only on 26-6-58 he would pass away. Every one of these predictions came out true.

To a doctor in Saidapet, it was predicted in 1950 that on 19-12-1953 he would meet with an accident and that he would not escape it. On the 19th, he did not go to his consulting hall. He avoided driving his car and sat comfortably in his easy chair at home, absorbed in reading a medical magazine. Meanwhile, his daughter crawled and went under a cow, in between her four legs. The doctor, by chance, noticed it, got alarmed and suddenly got up. The floor slipped and he fell down, breaking his left arm. There was the fracture on 19-12-1953.

A high official wanted to celebrate the marriage of his son with a bride in Madras, though many brides parties had approached him. I selected the chart of a bride in Bangalore and said, "This Bangalore bride will be your daughter-in-law and not the one in Madras, though you have decided to have the Madras bride". He emphatically said "No, No, No! I am sure, your prediction will fail. Tomorrow the people from Madras are coming to my house for betrothal." I replied, "Dear sir, an ordinary layman's word may fail, but this is an astrological finding. It cannot go in vain. It is certain that, even if Thirunethran were to bless you all, you cannot have the Madras bride as your daughter-in-law." The next day dawned and, as already predicted, his son got married in that particular week to the beautiful Bangalore bride.

Here is an instance where a rich, strong-willed businessman miserably failed to maintain his word. On 10th July, 1958 I was consulted by a businessman in Madras in regard to his illness. It was classified as a complicated disease by the medical experts after a careful clinical examination. It was predicted that he would be in bed till 20th of the month, i.e. for another 10 days, though his temperature would come down to normal on 16th and that he could attend to his business on and from 28th. Actually his temperature came to normal on 16th and he was picking up health. On the 27th, he invited me and said, "The prediction as regards my ailment has come true. In spite of expert treatment, the high temperature has persisted. It was in the hands of Karma. So I had to suffer. I suffered. But mind you! I have decided on not going to my office today and attending to my business. Going or not going to office is entirely in my hands. You say that everything is destiny, I can shape my destiny here, by exercising my will." The eventful day came and, at 2.00 p.m., there was an urgent call to the businessman asking him to come to office at once. He had to go and he did go to his office at 3.00 p.m. that day. He could not avoid going as the matter was beneficial and also serious. Immediately he phoned to me and said, "Hats off! Astrology has won: I am now phoning from my office." That, even in such minor affairs, one cannot exercise his will and change the destiny, it proved beyond doubt.

I was giving a lecture in Bharateeya Vidya Bhavan, Delhi, at 6 p.m. on a Thursday in September 1962. One gentleman came to me and interrupted in the middle, saying, "Sir, a week ago I lost a purse containing Rs. 827 in the Bazaar street. I consulted a few; all were of opinion that it was lost once for all. May I know whether I can get it back or is it a total loss to me?" I asked for a number, explained it to the students and said, "Sir, you will be getting it intact next Wednesday. It has been picked up by a banker or an advocate or a professor." The next Wednesday, the gentleman got back his purse as predicted, bought sweets and distributed the same to the students. He said, "Sir, your prediction is wonderful. A professor had found it and handed it over to me intact only today, Wednesday." As I am not writing to folio, I shall content myself with the above examples where I have made it clear that destiny is unalterable and astrological predictions correctly presaged must come true.

Astrology is the science that explains the laws of nature. It is entirely based on the theory of karma and reincarnation. At the same time, it supports Newton's third law of motion, which states that every action has an equal reaction. This proves that no action will go to waste and nothing can happen without a cause, which is why astrology is considered to be a convincing science. Accurate results predicted by an able astrologer will surely come to pass. Whether one does Shanti or not, it cannot offer complete protection from evils. It does not guarantee success in all cases.
Those who believe in Shanti may ask, "If one can't modify or nullify the evil by doing Shanti, why have the sages prescribed various Shanties to ward off evil? If every action has to produce a reaction or cause an effect, then how can Shanti performed go in vain without removing the evil? Hindus perform Pujas and Homas, pray to Gods and Planets, construct choultries and hospitals, feed the poor and the disabled, do charity and assist the needy, etc. Cannot these virtuous deeds mitigate the affliction? In other countries, though they do not perform homa, etc., they still do charity or help fellow beings and animals without having faith or expecting any beneficial result in overcoming difficulties. Even then, whether they have faith or not, whether they do it with a set purpose or not, should not such casual or continuous meritorious action help such persons to get rid of evil?"

Astrology says that destiny cannot be altered. What is meant by destiny is not generally properly understood by non-astrologers. Karma is that which is already done in the previous birth. Destiny includes all actions done in that birth and the results which one is to enjoy. One's destiny may force him to do Shanti and give complete protection by removing the anticipated evil or only to an insignificant extent, or it may prevent one from performing any Shanti at all. Destiny ultimately gives the result, which one has surely to experience, without any alteration. People have to submit to fate, otherwise termed destiny.

## Shanti to ward off evil
Therefore, people may be classified into four groups. One group will be those who do Shanti and enjoy the results desired by them, and may attribute the benefit to the Shanti; the other group will do Shanti, yet suffer, without any appreciable redemption, and say that however much they offered Shanti, it did no good. The third group will neither do Shanti nor believe in it, though they live happily, roll in wealth, have success after success, and enjoy enviable results. The fourth group never does Shanti, but ever suffers.

The circumstances under which one is placed, one's natural expectations and normal anticipation, one's performing Shanti either out of fear or for favor, and the ultimate results are all due to one's previous karma. All these can be read from one horoscope and it is possible for the astrologer to estimate the seriousness of the karma. Have we not seen in "Nadis" written by the sages that advice is offered to do various Shanties depending on one's past action?

Karma can be divided broadly into three kinds: Dhruda Karma, Dhruda Adhruda Karma, and Adhruda Karma. By Dhruda Karma, it is meant that one has committed an inexcusable mistake or crime in the previous birth, such as murder, denying food and shelter to the invalid old parents, cheating the minor brothers during partition, denying the wages to the poor class of helpless servants, cheating, and ingratitude. Such malefactors, ungrateful children, dishonest brothers, mighty masters, and cheats may do any amount of Shanti, but they cannot ward off the malefic results to the desired extent, as the crime is serious and unpardonned. Though to a negligible extent, it will be reduced, as no action will go to waste and every action has its own result. But the same Shanti, done by people who have committed pardonable mistakes, mitigates the affliction in full and leaves them unscathed. For example, if "A" has borrowed Rs. 56,000 and "B" has taken only Rupees one hundred as loan, and "A" repays rupees one hundred, while "B" also repays one hundred, "A" has yet to suffer as the loan cleared is negligible and the burden is yet more or less the same. But "B" is carefree and regains peace of mind. Therefore, such Dhruda Karma people have to accept the punishment, undergo the trial, and patiently endure the penalty. In such cases, "Avasyam Anubokthavyam Krishna Karma Subhasubham" will apply. Whether they pray to God or they perform any Shanti, they should reap the consequences of the previous Karma with practically no appreciable modification because of the Shanti done.
God is all merciful; yet He is all attentive to His Duty in administering justice. He is fully aware of the Karma which one has done in the previous birth, the Shanti or virtuous deed one will do in this birth, and His impartial judgement is the result which one will enjoy. God knows what Shanti one will do, how far it would mitigate, and what the result would be.
In the horoscopes of those who have done Dhruda Karma, the Dasanatha, the Bhukthinatha, Lagna, and Moon will be devoid of the beneficial aspect from Jupiter and from the lord of the 9th house, who indicates the virtuous deed done in the previous birth.
Dhruda Adhruda Karma means that one would have committed an excusable mistake in the previous birth. It is just like an ignorant person having purchased a ticket to Bombay getting into Calcutta Mail. The Inspector finds out the mistake and points it to him. The passenger pleads ignorance and prays for excuse. The examiner leaves him without any punishment. In such persons' horoscopes, either the Lagna or Moon or Dasanatha or Bhukthinatha will receive favourable aspects from either Jupiter or Lord of 9 or both. Here the crime committed is so simple that he can be excused on his humble application.
A constable can excuse a driver for having driven a car on the wrong side if he gives a satisfactory explanation, such as skidding or puncture, etc., especially when there is neither traffic nor accident. But the same constable cannot excuse the driver if the car runs over a boy. Hence, excuse or no excuse depends on the seriousness of the crime.
The third one is Adhruda Karma. The crime committed may be negligible. It might have ended only in an evil thought. Suppose a young boy finds a fruit-bearing tree in a house overhanging on the road side and goes near it and, like a vulture, is moving there alone with a desire to have the fruit. The owner notes the boy and whistles. The boy understands that the owner is watching him and so he retraces his steps honourably. He does not remove the fruit. The boy had only the evil thought but he did not commit theft. Such ones may be classified as Adhruda Karma. In such persons' horoscope, Guru or Lord of 9 will be in the Lagna or conjoined with Moon or Dasanatha or Bhukthinatha. Such people will enjoy life though they do not perform any Shanti, nor pray nor donate for a good cause in this birth. One should not forget that Karma of the previous birth and Shanti or no Shanti in this birth result in the final destiny, which is the impartial judgement of God, which was already, once for all, decided at the time of birth. This is called "that which is written on the head" (Thalai Ezhuththu). This can be read from the horoscope. God writes on the head only once. He does not alter now and then as and when the Shanti is done. Nor can the birth time be changed. The horoscope will ever remain the same. Hence, the results indicated must come to pass. We know that doing or not doing Shanti is also indicated in the horoscope. The variety of Shanti which one may be advised to do depends upon the planets which rule his time and also the nature of the results which the native desires to have.
In a lady's chart, Rahu and Saturn are in the fifth house and both are in the constellation of the lord of the sixth house. The native was married in Mercury (Budha Dasa), Jupiter Bhukti (Guru sub-period). Saturn Bhukthi followed. Years passed, but it did not give her the pleasure of having a child. Kethu Dasa followed. Every fourth week disappointed her and her husband, so the couple became anxious. They approached an astrologer who said that, in her chart, Jupiter was conjoined with Kethu in the eleventh house while Sani and Rahu were in the fifth. So he advised that, if they did Santhi, they would surely have a child during Kethu Dasa, Guru Bhukti in Moolam Star. As per his advice, they visited Benares, then Rameswaram, and finally Guruvayur Krishna, at the time when Guru Bhukti just started. They also did some charity. They had a child born before her Kethu Dasa Guru Bhukti ended. (Here the chart denotes the lord of Lagna is Jupiter who is conjoined with Dasanatha Kethu. That she will take the advice and do shanthi is clearly shown. Guru in the eleventh house promises progeny. So she had a child during Guru's period. The child was born in Moolam Star which is governed by Kethu, in Jupiter's sign Sagittarius).
It may be asked, if she had not gone to these holy places, could she have had the child. The astrologer will say that she would have a child whether she worked off the evil by such pilgrimage or not and also that she would visit, to wipe off the malefic effects and receive the blessing of God in the shape of a boy whether the astrologer advised it or not. Both are her fate.
It is my finding that the sub and constellation in which the moon will be transiting at the time of the birth of the child will be governed by the Dasanatha and Bhuktinatha or the lords of the constellation in which they were found in the parent's charts.
Two friends, A and B, requested an astrologer to suggest a remedy, as they were suffering from eye trouble. The astrologer found that in A's birth chart, the evil period was coming to an end, whereas in B's chart, the future was becoming worse. He suggested to them that "Surya Namaskaram" would be effective. He also added that A would have the benefit, whereas B could not expect any improvement. Both decided to do Shanthi. A found all favourable conditions for him to do it satisfactorily and enjoyed beneficial results. B had many obstacles and impediments even to perform "Suryanamaskaram", but with all that, he managed to do the Shanthi. Unfortunately, he had no improvement.
Thus, it can be shown that it is possible for an astrologer to say whether one can have the chance to do offerings to God and whether one will have the advantage of such an action or not, by reading the horoscopes and ascertaining what variety of Karma they ought to have done in the previous birth and also the seriousness of the Karma.
Shanthi is of two kinds: Thrishta Shanthi and Athrishta Shanti. By Thrishta Santhi is meant that one knows what Shanthi they should do and that they are aware of the results of such a remedial measure. If one suffers from a headache and takes Aspro, Saridon, Anacin, or Codopyrin, they know that these are specifics for headache and they get relief. A few, even after taking the specific, may continue to suffer, which is also their fate. Here, the native is aware of their taking the medicine and also its curing effect. This is Thrishta Shanthi.
Athrishta means that which one can't see with naked eyes and non-astrological eyes. Athrishta Shanthi brings results without the knowledge of the person. Nor can the person judge the nature of favourable result they may enjoy and also whether Athrishta Shanthi includes homa, prayers, pilgrimage, construction of hospitals, maternity homes, schools, choultries, feeding the poor, donating blood, or fasting on Somavaram days, but the nature of the beneficial result which they may enjoy is not known. That is why it is called Athrishta.
Thus, it will be seen that astrology can show what Karma one should have done in the previous birth, whether one will do Shanthi or not in this life, and the ultimate results one is to enjoy. It is also known that every action will have its reaction, i.e. good actions yield desirable results, whereas bad actions bring evil to the native.
As doing Shanthi is always considered to be a virtue and therefore it has necessarily to bring favourable results to the doer, it is advisable that one either prays to God or does Homa or contributes for a good cause.
The number of people who commit inexcusable crimes like murder amounting to Dhruda Karma will be very few. The number of people who do not commit any crime at all but occasionally think of evil, known as Adhruda Karma, will be still fewer. Both form a very small minority. But the majority of people commit excusable mistakes called Dhruda Adhruda Karma. 
Therefore, Shanthi will be done by them with or without their knowledge and they will not ultimately suffer. 
As a layman may not know which variety of Karma they could have done in the previous birth, they will assume that they are one among many and that the performance of Shanthi will give them solace and peace of mind and ward off suspense, which is highly painful. They can entertain hopes and it gives mental solace.
Shanthi may be compared to taking a prophylactic vaccine against cholera, typhoid, or having revaccination against smallpox. Such a preventive measure gives confidence and immunity. One can visit the infected areas with courage and mix with such patients, though it may not guarantee that all those who had taken preventive measures will never suffer. Even if one contracts the disease, the attack will be very mild.
If one does not perform Shanthi or any virtuous deed, they can't be confident about their happiness in the future. There will be the doubt whether it will be peaceful or miserable. A few may live happily, but many will suffer from untold miseries.
One attends to minor repairs to their car before starting out and arrives with confidence. Two other people drive without testing it. One car returns safely and the other car breaks down. Is it not advisable to have the car examined by an expert, have the minor repairs attended to, and then alone drive? Just as the repairs can give confidence to the driver about the peaceful nature of the journey, even so the performance of Shanthi will be hopeful to relieve one from worries and give mental strength during the period of suspense.
Astrology indicates who will do Shanthi and attribute the reduction of the evil result to Shanthi alone. The person may be ignorant of the fact that their fate was that they should do Shanthi and they unnecessarily expected a more serious trouble, whereas only a mild one was their fate.
Astrology advises all to be good, to do Shanthi in any form and enjoy life with absolute peace of mind.

Medical Astrology
Health is wealth. Money can make many things possible when one desires and acts; however, God can offer everything whether one wants it or not, according to one's Karma done in the previous birth. God may bless one with money, but at the same time the native may have to suffer any one of the incurable, chronic, and loathsome diseases according to their destiny. Hence, the greatest problem which is to be faced by human beings is the maintenance of good health. To have immunity and resistance against infections and diseases, and a certain cure for the disease from which one suffers, one consults a medical expert. Astrologers opine that a physician can safely administer medicine if they are acquainted with astrology. This means that, in the absence of astrological knowledge to start with, the doctor has often to proceed only by trial and error methods and apply remedies by rule of thumb until they have eliminated many diseases, by varied examinations and ascertained the precise nature and cause of the disease. But if they were to know astrology, they can locate the part of the body affected, detect the disease, and select the opportune time for treatment. This will bring good name, fame, and satisfactory remuneration to the doctor and also restore the patient to normal health; otherwise, the patient will have to become a guinea-pig for experimental tortures. This will result in loss of time and often in loss of life; it will end in loss to the nation also. But if a doctor knows astrology and medicine sufficiently well, they will prove to be a really successful practitioner. Hippocrates, renowned as the "Father of Medicine", has stated "A physician cannot safely administer medicine if they are not acquainted with astrology". Medical astrology is concerned with the diagnosis of diseases, the methods of healing, the time of the onset of the ailment, the duration of the disease, and the psychiatric aspects that may influence the progress and prognosis of the diseases.

Fortunately for the public in America, there are many physicians and surgeons who have learnt astrology and make use of this knowledge with pleasant, successful, and gratifying results. There are astrological schools in the US and Europe with medical astrology as one of the subjects. They consider this as a very important branch of astrology which needs the combination of an astrologer and a physician who will enjoy success in their life. They can choose an auspicious time to begin treatment, to mix, dispense, and administer medicine, to do operations, to discharge from the nursing home, etc. After they have thoroughly studied astrology, they will feel very happy when they are capable of differentiating the pulmonary affection of a patient. They can say whether one suffers from cold and cough or dry cough or from Eosinophilia or Asthma or TB or Pleurisy or Bronchitis or Pneumonia, etc. It is easy to predict whether one suffers from mumps, or measles, or chicken pox or smallpox. It is not difficult to say whether one has only menstrual trouble or must have the uterus removed or the suffering is due to fibroid tumour or cancer. Such a good knowledge of astrology would be a great asset to them. Further, by finding out when and where an epidemic may range, the Institutes of Preventive Medicine can manufacture prophylactic vaccines and the Public Health Department can educate the public and carry on mass inoculation; exercise extra care on proper sterilisation and supply of wholesome water; do away with wells not in use and also take other precautionary measures if it is a water-borne disease. 

There need not be so much rush to hospitals; beds will be available without difficulty. There will be no necessity to extend the hospitals and increase the beds also to experience the dearth of doctors and nurses. A wise astrologer, in their own way, may consider that they are superior in intellect to a medical person in quickly diagnosing the nature of the disease, the duration of ill-health, and the final result. If one is found in the street unconscious, a medical attendant is to smell the mouth, to know whether the patient is drunk, to feel the belly to ascertain whether it is food poisoning, or to record their temperature to find out whether it would be a sun-stroke, or guess whether it could be due to exhaustion after much exertion, or guess whether it is due to hysteria, epilepsy, etc. They guess to start with, and try to do good to the patient by administering a medicine. But an astrologer remaining in a place, many miles away, even without seeing the patient, by phone, can mention the cause of their unconsciousness which will be found surprisingly true and later confirmed by the doctor attending on them.

Astrology is a wonderful science that, when practiced properly, can bring good health, reduce medical bills, increase longevity, and minimize mortality. When such benefits can be enjoyed by people, the world will produce wise astrologers. One may ask, "How can one avoid disease if they are destined to suffer?" I do agree, but when medical astrology is introduced in medical colleges and all become wise astrologers and physicians, the sufferings will naturally be reduced. This day will surely come, and it is coming.

The new era is fast approaching - the dawn of the Aquarian age. Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, which produces supremely intelligent and wise astrologers with intuition and introspection to offer amazing predictions. Aquarius is the best sign for grand success in research, especially in the useful branches of science, as it produces good reasoners, both theoretical and practical, with radical and advanced ideas and a good mentality.

The vernal equinox is now at 6° 44' of Nirayana Pisces (Meena). So it is in Uthra Pathrapada star. Hence, Jupiter's beneficial aspects are waning, while the aspects of Saturn and Mercury are becoming more and more prominent.

In India, early marriage was in vogue until 1930, and thereafter it has been declared a crime, as the age limit of the couple for marriage has been raised by legislation. It is plain to a non-astrologer that the government is responsible for this. But ask an astrologer, "Is it because of the government's initiative that the age limit is raised?" "No," will be their emphatic reply. They will add that, as time passes, according to the fate of the subjects in a nation, as indicated by the age of the world, the mind of the authorities will get so changed that they would decide and act in a manner indicated by planets, which can be read with a knowledge of astrology. They may attribute this as though they have done it, without realizing that it is the unknown force (due to the effect of the fate of the future subjects) that made them do so. With the knowledge of astrology, much of the unknown will become known, the mysterious will become plain, and correct light will be shed.

Aquarius (Kumbha) is governed by Saturn, and Pisces (Meena) is ruled by Jupiter (Guru). It is a common question put by parents to astrologers, "When do you find Guru Belem (i.e., beneficial effects of Jupiter) to my daughter or boy to celebrate marriage?" By that, one can understand that we believe in the beneficial (Jupiter) Guru's strength to have the marriage arranged by parents and celebrated in youth or at least immediately after one attains the age of maturity. As the Sayana Aries (Mesha) 0° in the 20th century coincides with the commencement of the second pada or quarter of Uthrapathrapada or Uthrattadhi Nakshathra (Star) ruled by Sani and the sub by Sukra (Venus), the age limit has to be raised. Further, malefic Sani (called a tempter) shows delay, crosses, disharmony, disappointment, and divorce, as well as secret pleasant activities by a few, or an increase in the number of inter-caste marriages by throwing away the tradition, are all due to this astrological fact based on the astronomical phenomena.

It is evident that Venus (Sukra) has improved all domains, and Jupiter is losing strength. Venus is the chief governor for music. In olden days, to bear one good musician was once in a blue moon, a rare occurrence, whereas now we have television, transistors, radio, gramophone, tape recorders, cinema, drama, and more. Many music colleges have been opened, which have produced a large number of good musicians night and day in every nook and corner of the world; even when we sail or travel, we hear music relayed from all over the world in various languages.

Venus is the Karaka for Vahana and transport. Let us consider how many kinds of conveyances our forefathers had. Are we not enjoying the benefits of cycles, motor cycles, scooters, cars, lorries, steamers, aeroplanes, helicopters, etc., thereby covering long distances in a very short time?

Venus is the chief ruler of ladies. Was there any association or club for them in ancient days? Was it not rare to see ladies in colleges, lady doctors in hospitals, and lady officials in offices? We have heard of Queens alone. Now, how advanced ladies are, having co-education and working alongside men in offices!

Thus, it will be seen that all changes that we observe are in accordance with the Great Age of the Earth. Therefore, it is certain that at the time when actually the Aquarian age runs, i.e., in about 475 years, astrology will regain popularity and this knowledge will be used to the utmost advantage of the people. It is not unlikely that the people attribute the advantages to astrology. But, actually, the Aquarian age will reduce the number of patients and produce many wise astrologers and physicians with correct intuition. As Aquarius opposes Leo, most of the deaths will be sudden, due to heart failure, only at the age indicated in the chart. As Leo represents heart, Aquarian age decreases the number of deaths due to prolonged and lingering diseases and increases sudden, and pleasant end.

Thus, when medical astrology finds general support and every medical expert is also a wise astrologer, we can take it for granted that the Aquarian age has commenced and diseases will be kept under control, and a few hospitals will be converted as hostels for students of astrology.

Astro-Meteorology
Astro-meteorology is useful for predicting the conditions of the weather and has received considerable attention in other countries, where it has been found to be very useful for pre-planning and thereby preventing any catastrophes such as heavy rains causing floods and breaches, or drought leading to poor crops, famine, polluted water, and epidemics. There is no use in complaining against anyone or criticizing any department; one can observe daily the weather reports given by meteorologists, who cannot be expected to be one hundred percent correct. It is important to remember the proverb "to err is human" and to recognize that sudden changes of weather, unexpected depressions in the bay, and storms are divine. Meteorologists cannot predict with certainty when and where one can expect breaches due to downpour of rain, or in which year there will be no rain so that intermittently restricted quantity of water may be supplied, commencing fairly early to avert the drought. However, astrology can give a correct picture years in advance, provided more research is carried out by intelligent, able, and learned astrologers.

This branch of science is becoming popular in other countries and has been developed to a marvellous degree of accuracy by a number of research workers. It has no connection whatsoever with the common almanacs published by the Government Weather Bureau. One of the greatest of astrologers, Llewellyn George, says, "It is only a matter of time, however, when nations generally will recognize this information and include it in their present calculations, thus making their system more practical, serviceable, and efficient". Indeed, this branch will benefit the government, agriculturists, and engineers to a great extent.

Judicial Astrology
Judicial Astrology is a branch of this science which gives knowledge to predict important events which a country will pass through, such as wars, earthquakes, financial improvement or crisis, losses by fire, flood, famine, etc. At present, Judicial Astrology is not complete and exhaustive; it may be said that it is yet in a preliminary stage. It has to be developed to a very great extent to offer useful predictions, when the public can take advantage of such clear and definite forecasts.

With the knowledge that one can gain with the present literature, it is impossible to predict exactly in which quarter a particular trouble or calamity can be expected, by whom, why, and when. But it will be vague. An astrologer cannot but mention many alternatives. That is why a few make sad confusions while predicting. The rules are too intricate to admit of clear definition and too contradictory to be easily and perspicuously reconciled.

Every sign indicates many countries and many towns. The whole world has five continents, each of which has many countries, innumerable cities, and just like stars, countless villages. The localities are many, but the signs are only twelve. So all these are to be indicated by these twelve signs only; i.e., let us imagine that letters are written and posted to people in each town in various countries in the world. The postal department has only twelve bags called Aries (Mesha), Taurus (Rishaba), Gemini (Mithuna), and so on, up to Pisces (Meena). So they have to sort suitably letters to all these localities in these twelve bags only. Each bag will be filled with many letters to various places.

Similarly, all these towns and countries are to be distributed among these twelve signs, and each sign, therefore, has to indicate many localities, e.g., Aries (Mesha) denotes Burgundy, England, Denmark, Germany, Palestine, Syria, etc., and many towns. If Aries is afflicted, normally, what is it that one can predict? Any or many of these places will have some trouble or other with many alternatives mentioned. None can predict precisely the exact place and the particular nature of trouble that one can expect and when, except to guess or to give confusing or vague predictions. Clear and definite predictions alone will be of immense use.

Generally, the tendency and ambition of an astrologer is to make attempts to predict events in every branch of astrology. The ambition will be achieved and it will prove to be beneficial if one specializes in one branch and gains some knowledge in the other branches also. Then alone one will be able to offer clear and correct predictions of which the government and the public can take advantage.

Let us take medicine; medical experts specialize in any one branch and contribute their mite; some specialize in optical surgery; some in E.N.T.; some in pulmonary diseases; some cardiac; some leprosy; some osseous system; some nervous system; some circulatory and so on. Why? Because they have realized the fact that it is difficult to master every branch by one and the same person in one's lifetime. Trying to master everything, they may not know anything useful to the patient.

Similarly, let us consider engineering. How many branches there are: e.g., mechanical, automobile, aeronautic, electrical, civil, public health, etc. Any one branch specialized means sound knowledge to the student in that branch and advantage to the public. Therefore, astrologers also should specialize before offering predictions in any one of the branches and even there, understand the insufficient data to give definite prediction, being aware of their limitations. Such astrologers, no doubt, will restore the reputation of the noble science, Astrology.

One or two predictions by a few astrologers may be taken for our consideration to judge whether these are in any way helpful or really harmful. One astrologer says that the configurations of the Planets in 1962-63-64 must be considered together. In many countries, crime wave and criminal activities will reach a new height. A few countries will witness famine conditions for some reason or other. Earthquake in some places will cause damage to property. Of course, in the countries and places wrecked by natural catastrophe, criminal activities also will prevail on a large scale.

The above is the prediction. Nowhere, the unexpected trouble encountered in October 1962, which is the first of its kind, was mentioned clearly (giving at least the week when such a difficulty could be expected and exactly from which source and why from that quarter alone). But it is said that there will be in this year, very disastrous natural catastrophes like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, storms, excessive and untimely rain and snowfall, high death rate, and many accidents; how many alternatives? "Oh! God," says the reader. He asks why can't one definitely state which of these troubles is to be expected and where. How can a reader select any one of these? By offering such predictions, do not they unnecessarily create panic and fear in the minds of the general public, whereas astrology is intended more to give useful information, mental solace, and encouragement? Is it not a psycho-therapy?

Astrologers Should Not Afflict the Public with the Terrors of Severe Issues
Even when one is confident about one's predictions, one should convey them with sympathetic concern, in a mild tone, emphasizing the seriousness of the event but should not omit to make mention of it. Also, a few readers may feel that astrologers need not offer such useless predictions with thousands of alternatives.

Another takes a few horoscopes to read the fate of a country. One horoscope is said to be that of India, the other is claimed to be that of Independence, the third is mentioned as that of a ruler, and so on. He mentions a series of calamities taking into consideration any one of the three horoscopes. And analysing another horoscope, he gives courage saying that India will be left unscathed. When one waits and sees, the country had for the first time in the same month the unprecedented experience of the invasion by a neighbouring country, and vital changes in the administration also.

If one were to predict bad events, considering any one horoscope and also say that there is nothing to worry by reading another chart, the reader is not benefited. He does not know which is to be taken: either we will have trouble or we will be left unscathed. Such a prediction reminds one of the tactful astrologer who mentions to the husband of an expectant lady that his wife would give birth to a boy, and to the expectant mother, a girl. The readers request the astrologer, who is capable of predicting precisely, to offer definite predictions and avoid vague ones which are not really useful but actually harmful.

Honestly, we have to realise our limitations while offering predictions with the knowledge that can be gained with the literature available at present, as well as the necessity to mention thousands of alternatives. We all know that one cannot give clear, correct, and precise predictions as this branch of science is incomplete. However, some learned scholars were nearly correct in a few predictions, showing that judicial astrology is correct though incomplete. There are many instances, but a few alone are given. William Lily predicted that there would be a fire accident in 1666 in London, which came true. The Japanese Royal astrologers correctly predicted Japan's victory over Russia in 1905. America was warned in 1907 that it would face a financial crisis, which came very true. And it was not that there were no failures in their predictions. Failure, if any, was due to the difficulty with this branch of science, which is incomplete. These should be taken by the students of astrology as opportunities for earnest and intelligent research.

They have to note down the dates when some events happened in their country, the planetary positions on those dates, and apply the astrological principles. Only after many instances can one judge which sign and which degree and minute in it represents a town, and this finding is absolutely necessary to minimise the alternatives. Now we are not in possession of such data to offer clear predictions, and hence any prediction now given includes many alternatives.

There is another problem for research. About one hundred years ago, when astrologers predicted taking Virgo or Capricorn for India, they predicted that India would face some difficulties as these signs are afflicted. At that time, the prediction included sufferings of the people in the present independent India and the partitioned Pakistan also, since both were ruled by one King and the boundary of India then included Pakistan. Now also, the same signs are to be taken for India and Pakistan, and any prediction that India will be in danger will apply to Pakistan also.

It may be argued that either the Independence Chart or the formation of the Ministry or the chart of the Minister may be taken as the basis for prediction. Consideration of so many charts will lead to contradictory indications and indefiniteness in the predictions. Unless this branch is very well developed, one need not attach much weight to the predictions offered and get confused. A reader poses the following question to the astrologer who offers prediction: "All know that there was an earthquake in Bihar. Did anyone predict that Bihar alone will be afflicted and not Benares, Bhopal, or Baroda? The combination of the planets or their disposition is the same for all these places. Then why should Bihar alone face this calamity?" No explanation can be offered as to why Bihar alone should be victimized, because nowhere is it mentioned that Bihar, which is in a particular latitude and longitude on Earth, is represented by a particular declination and right ascension in the Zodiac. This branch of science to that extent is incomplete. If every locality is allotted a particular position in the Zodiac, one can easily predict with confidence about a particular locality, say Bihar. Such finding alone will be useful to the public and to the Government.

It is hence necessary to complete this branch by systematic and methodical research. Till that time, it will be advantageous if one confines to the extent to which definite predictions can be offered. It may be mentioned here that on 7 May 1962, the Delhi Edition of Indian Express published a feature about the author that, in the course of his lectures at the Bharathiya Vidya Bhavan, Delhi, on 27 April 1961, he had predicted that the share market would tumble down after 15 October 1962 due to some evil in the North. But as he was not sure about the nature of the evil, he had mentioned a few alternatives in the light of literature available at the time. It will be of interest to know that, in this magazine, research on mundane astrology carried out by Mod-Ast-Res-Institute, Madras, will regularly appear, and on those occasions when clear predictions can be offered, they will be published well in advance for the benefit of all.
Natal astrology concerns largely with the life of human beings. A chart is made out for the moment of birth and for the particular place of birth (Latitude and Longitude being taken for calculation). From such a chart one can read all events about the native; their character, temperament and peculiarities, longevity, condition of health, accident proneness, finance and fortune, marriage, birth of children and also their prosperity or adversity. Moreover, the actual date of any occurrence in their life can be calculated. Thus, natal astrology is very useful for one and all, whether they are born a king, a Kubera, or a beggar, for health and longevity are precious to every individual. Fortune, prosperity, and above all, peace of mind and happiness are desired by all. Hence, natal astrology is the most useful branch of this science and therefore, it behoves all of us to support and encourage genuine research, by trained workers and scholars, to bridge the incomplete phases in this, just as in every other branch of science.
It is a fact that 100% correct predictions cannot be given with the literature available and with the knowledge that we may gain by studying them alone. It is only by plodding, preserving and patiently carrying out research that one will be able to fill up the gap, supplement, improve, and make it perfect. One of the sub-branches of Natal Astrology may be discussed for the consideration of the readers.
There is a sub-branch called "Gochara Phalan" by the Hindus. Westerners call it "Transit". Let it be stated, with great humility for the information of the readers, that the method of prediction adopted by research scholars is, in a way, an improvement over the application of the general principles of astrology handed down to us by our ancient sages and scholars.
In the Western system, the astrologers take the radical position of the Sun at the time of birth and consider the relative positions of the Planets transiting in the Zodiac and give their predictions. In India and in the Hindu system, the position of the Moon at the time of birth of the native is taken as the starting and determining point to which the transiting positions of the Planets are related, and according to their relative positions, we read the results and say whether the time is auspicious or not. Both the methods will be found to be incomplete and therefore the percentage of failures is bound to be large. This cannot be of much advantage to those who desire to know their future.
The Western and the Hindu systems of predictions based on the transits of Planets fall in many cases whether referred either to the Sun or to the Moon alone. For transitory results, Fortuna deserves serious attention as it indicates certain results which are not shown by the aspects formed by the transiting planets to those in the natal chart.
When it is found that the results enjoyed by people born within a few minutes of each other show diametrically opposite results, we should try and find out the factor which is so fast moving as to cause opposite aspects and bring about such different effects. In those few minutes can planets move much? No. Then which will have a change in the position? It is not Lagna, thereby Fortuna, and then M.C.
All research scholars will surely declare that the fast changing Ascendant and Fortuna cause different aspects and produce different results. If therefore Fortuna is also included in all calculations and predictions offered, there can be no great room for disappointment.
Readers will do well at this stage to pause and ponder over the significant truths placed before them in the preceding paragraphs. That astrology, no doubt, is an accurate science can be proved by taking the following instances.
Identical results are enjoyed by people whose birth took place at the same minute, in the same Latitude and Longitude. Let me place before the readers in a tangible and systematic form my reasons:
The first instance relates to two persons born at the same time and who both got married to two career girls who were earning. They had no children but both couples were very fond of domestic pets, cats and dogs. The two males were lecturers producing identical results, with equal interest in politics, philosophy and religion. Minor events also in their lives were strikingly similar; for example, both suffered from toothache at the same time and on the same day. Yet, the two male partners were in no way related to each other and hailed from widely separated places.
Another instance is about two men born in the same village who narrated their experiences after they had lived there for a fairly long time. Their temperaments, behaviour and character were identical. Both had pleasing manners, were always cheerful and never rude to anyone. Both were robust in health and whenever one fell ill, the other also ailed from the same disease. Each of them lost a child in the same month, and had the same number of children. One was a journalist, while the other was a writer of fiction. Mercury, Mars and Jupiter were the signs who ruled over their professions. The culmination in this extraordinary similarity was in the death of these two natives on the same day.
Yet another instance relates to a report that appeared in a foreign journal in 1820. It mentioned that Samuel Hennings died at the age of 82. He was born on 4-6-1738 at a place situated in the same Latitude and Longitude as King George III, who ascended the throne in October 1760. Mr. Hennings was then an independent businessman. King George III got married on 8-9-1761 and on the same day Mr. Hennings took Elsie for his wife. Both had the same number of children of each sex. Both were long-lived and died at the same hour on 2-9-1820.
Instances can be multiplied for such remarkably coincident happenings. The principles governing such events will be explained later.

Horary Astrology
This branch of science is mysterious, perfect, wonderful, and most useful. After thoroughly understanding the principles, one can offer correct, clear, and precise predictions without any confusion. This helps the astrologer to confirm what prediction he or she has to give by using other methods which, when explained, will convince and satisfy the consultant.
Generally, the astrologer asks the querist to give a number, at random, within 108. The number that is given forms the basis for the prediction. Some may scoff at this branch of science, saying that the predictions given by Horary Astrology cannot be correct as the number given is, after all, a chance. They may suggest that the person could have given any other number or thought of one number and mentioned another. Such people do not realize that the querist cannot give any other number except the one which he or she had given. Occasionally, the lucky querist may mention a number, but the astrologer may mishear and calculate on the misheard number. Here, the divine force so works that the number taken by the astrologer gives a clear and correct answer, whereas the other number, mentioned by the querist, cannot offer a clear clue to the astrologer. They have no personal experience that it is the divine force which works and enables the astrologer to predict. The number that he or she gives depends upon his or her past action or Karma as well as the future results he or she is to enjoy, just as the moment of birth is the effect of his or her past Karma. None can convince that one's birth at the particular moment, whether normal or Caesarian, is a chance. If one were to reiterate, one is ignorant of the wonderful Divine Law. Do they have the choice of parents?
Generally, this branch of science is resorted to mainly by those who have no horoscopes or who doubt the correctness of them. This branch of science can never answer all questions and clear all doubts. Occasionally, it may appear for the beginners as though there are contradictory indications in astrology when they try to predict using other methods of prognostication. On those occasions, they can make the best use of Horary astrology for proper guidance and confirmation. Even when one is confident about one's own prediction in the other branches of the science, Horary Astrology has to be used as a final safe method to declare with confidence the results already obtained.
Suppose two people stand for election in the same locality or for any single seat as President, Chairman, etc. Horoscopes may or may not be correct. Even if correct charts are given, there may be a doubt whether 'A' will come out victorious or 'B'. That is why some predictions offered without using Horary system miserably failed. To be sure of one's prediction, Horary Astrology is the best and most reliable to be used with advantage.
This method is as rational and as scientific as any other branch of astrology and it is the sublime art of foreseeing events from the position of the Planets at the moment when one propounds seriously a question about any important matter. By applying it, one can predict the longevity, health, success or failure in one's enterprise, one's stay in foreign land or his or her return, the time of marriage, the description of partner, re-union or divorce, birth and death of children, sex of the child, results of the examination, recovery of lost articles, gain by lottery or races or speculation, success in litigation, treasure, legacy, and anything and everything on the earth.
This branch of science is not a bluff, it is not to dupe the gullible throng. But at the same time, it is not easy for the students of astrology to make predictions infallibly unless they are thorough with the principles of astrology available now. Some mistake that the astrologer uses Numerology and predicts. They are ignorant. The Number indicates the ascendant for that query and he or she calculates the position of planets for that moment, and then judges the result.

Electional Astrology is the branch which indicates the most auspicious time for commencing any new undertaking, such as marriage, upanayana, purchase of costly articles, construction of houses and buildings, admission to hospitals, performing religious and social functions, purchase of a car, admission to schools and colleges, joining duty, taking or handing over charge of duty, and purchasing lottery tickets.

Kabbalah Astrology
This will be dealt with in detail in another book.
Kerala Astrology
This prediction is offered by looking at a person's face or asking them to mention the name of a flower and having it as the basis for prediction. This also will be dealt with in another book.

Omens
Who wishes to predict or select a moment using any of these branches, it is necessary to look at the omens at the time of prediction. These will agree with the results obtained by either Horary, Kabala, or Kerala branches of astrology and it is useful for predicting with clarity and confidence. Omens are clear and correct indicators and thus they are good guidance for astrologers. Bhattotpala says in Prasnagyana that good or bad effects can be predicted through the internal and external omens which are the deciding factors. There are people who take a decision after noting the omens; they never proceed further in a matter, such as fixing up a marriage or purchasing a house, if the omens are ill and disheartening. Varahamihira says that an omen reveals the fruition of one's action, good or bad, done in the previous birth. The omens are not superstitious beliefs; omen is otherwise called "SAGUNA". This is a vast subject. It needs no skill to predict. One can refer to the subject on omens elaborately dealt with by Varahamihira in Brihath Samhita, and note the result directly. If, at a particular time, there is more than one omen, then the interpretation depends upon the individual. Anyhow, one should be intelligent.

## WHO CAN LEARN ASTROLOGY

Often people approach me and express their difficulties with the art of astrological predictions. One of them said, "Sir, there was always an ardent desire in me to learn astrology. When I had the opportunity to study the science regularly, I earnestly worked night and day and tried to understand the principles. When I felt that I would be able to read the horoscopes, my friends gave me some charts and asked me to offer my findings. Various ideas flashed in my mind, but I found contradictory indications confusing and depressing me. Finally, I made a sincere attempt to predict, but I did not have much to say and only mentioned a few words. On finding that the querist was not satisfied and continued to stay expecting me to predict something more, I looked at him and he also looked at me with pity. Anyhow, I again tried to predict something more, but I was going on repeating what I had already said; such an embarrassing situation discouraged me further. My friends also dissuaded me with a sarcastic smile. So, I got vexed and gave it up dejected. 

A few years passed and again there was the urge to learn astrology scientifically instead of committing to memory the rules and reproducing them like a parrot. Even then while studying, I came across certain portions which appeared to be just contrary to what is mentioned by another author. I did not find any improvement; confusion continued and I was actually perplexed. I thought that probably the science is a difficult, complicated and intricate one. Fortunately, I understand that you are bringing out a magazine rendering it simple, clear and convincing, which is the opinion of the readers.

Can you kindly tell me, Sir, whether I shall learn astrology and master it, so that I can be useful to others by offering predictions?"

Astrology is no doubt mysterious and abstruse. It deals with the relation of the Planets in the Heavens and the occurrences on the Earth.

The Students of Astrology
The students of astrology must acquire sufficient knowledge in astronomy and be proficient in elementary mathematics. They must be careful to avoid any mistakes in their calculations. They should be capable of preparing horoscopes accurately using the correct Ephemeris (Raphael's) or by using Drik almanacs alone. For Ayanamsa, they will find the information published in this book to be useful and correct. They must study various books on astrology published by scholars, as well as the original works propounded by our sages. They must think, analyse, and understand the spirit of the rules and apply them. They will come to the conclusion that stellar astrology is the best, most simple, and astoundingly accurate. They should record both fulfilled and unfulfilled predictions. When a prediction comes true by adopting certain principles, they should follow the same. If a method fails, they should find out what modifications are needed. They should not be discouraged by initial failures, as no child can run a race without falling down many times while attempting to walk in infancy, and no cyclist can learn to ride without some scratches and bruises. If an experienced cyclist assists the learner, they may avoid injuries. Similarly, a Guru, by the side of the student who predicts, will guide and correct them whenever necessary, which will give the student zeal as they come out successful. Study circles and astrological groups should be formed to discuss various problems and clear doubts. When predicting, the astrologer must thoroughly understand the querist's temperament. Even if the querist does not like to hear evil, the astrologer should still mention it, but express it in a very mild form. Just as a physician gives sugarcoated pills to a patient who dislikes bitter medicine, the astrologer should give the necessary information without allowing the querist to feel the bitterness.

The Astrologer: Qualifications and Considerations
The astrologer should not guess, but rather possess the power of correct judgement and interpretation. They should have a good vocabulary and use appropriate words. Intuition also plays a part, for which devotion to God and prayers without any disturbance are needed. The astrologer should enjoy peace of mind and be above wants, with no worries at all. To be a leader among astrologers, one should be able to argue, convince, and establish the correctness of their predictions. It is for the public to certify whether one is an able astrologer or not, and whether one can offer astounding predictions or not. It is unbecoming of an astrologer to boast themselves as an expert, except on such occasions when it may be absolutely necessary to create faith in others and impress upon them what they want to convey. An astrologer should not be over-confident; they should be calm, apply correct principles, follow many methods, and give clear indications. They should not exaggerate facts, etc.; otherwise they invite trouble later. They should never forget their limitations.

The astrologer should also understand psychology. For example, a lady was much worried for having issues at minimum intervals and all of them were girls. Again she was in the family way. If an astrologer, simply to please her, were to say that she would have a boy, they run double risk. Because, if again a girl is born to her, it is no wonder that the astrologer is not only abused by the party but also anti-propaganda will be carried on by a few of them in season and out of season as they are (1) disgusted and (2) disappointed. If the astrologer had told that she could expect a girl on this occasion also and if it is a boy in their joy the astrologer is excused. But if a girl is born as predicted, they will appreciate the science and wait for better luck at least next time.

Incorrect predictions bring ridicule to the science and also misfortune to the astrologer. One should be tactful also. It is advisable to predict correctly, not forgetting one's future, or better confess and dispose of the querist saying that they have not specialised that particular branch of the science.

Can a medical expert undertake to treat patients suffering from all diseases? Can an Engineer be an expert in all the branches of Engineering? Similarly, an astrologer can specialise in any aspect and cannot master all the branches.

One can be an astrologer if one's horoscope satisfies many of the following conditions. Uranus is traditionally (according to Westerners) the strongest planet to give knowledge in astrology. Hindus take Mercury (Budha) as the planet which creates interest in astrology. In fact, all prominent astrologers have not had Uranus always strong in their horoscopes. But it will be seen that Saturn and Mercury have much to do with astrology. (Have we not heard the usual proverb "Aye! That fellow has Saturn in the tongue? Vakkil Sani. Ever predicts evil and never he fails).

Mr. Carter warns those in whose charts Mercury and Jupiter are heavily afflicted to be very cautious when they forecast. From that, one can understand that Mercury should not be afflicted, as it is the astrological planet. He also says that Uranus is unsuited to practical exigencies, as one will commonly lack tact and patience which are the essentials for an astrologer. One is to be practical. Earthy signs, and planets Mars and Saturn make one useful and practical. Planets in airy signs may make one unpractical and dreamy. Fiery usually produce practical people but not always prudent or discreet people. Those born in Thulam (Libra) and airy sign, may employ themselves in flattering others and often fall easy victims to it. Astrologers should not under any circumstances flatter others and exaggerate things.

People having a planet in Kumba or Meena (Aquarius and Pisces) afflicting Uranus in any part of the map will be unconventional, original, and Bohemian. They may disregard the established custom and ancient traditions and many may be perverted.

People with any of the following combinations and favourable aspects can learn astrology and be useful to the querists: Western scholars are of opinion that Saturn and Moon give immense appetite to learn astrology, especially when they are in 1, 3, 9 or 10th Bhava (Houses). Saturn and Moon make the native industrious, honest, patient, plodding and persevering, all of which are essential to an astrologer. Uranus has a special attraction to astrology, but success or failure depends on the other aspects which Uranus receives. It may make one a research scholar or a perverted person with much of egoism, whereas astrology is meant more to subdue egoism. Good aspects and connection between Jupiter, Mercury and Uranus assist one to consider deeply, judge properly and interpret correctly. Mars' beneficial aspect to those planets gives the astrologer the argumentative faculty, the desire to succeed in the material field, and to lead in all pursuits. Only when Moon and Mercury have harmonious aspects, one can have clear exposition, proper wording, good vocabulary and intuition. Moon is called the mind. It is like a mirror exactly reflecting the object. Mercury is for supreme intelligence, as it governs the central nervous system. It is like a lens. Therefore, whenever these two planets either form or receive favourable aspects, they give high imagination, linguistic capability, keen observation, intuitive perception, quick grasp, retentive power, reproductive ability, fluency of speech and general success, especially in astrology. So, those who have strong Mercury will thoroughly analyse, properly apply and correctly predict. Saturn and Mercury forming good aspect in one's chart give concentration and depth of thought. The native will be exact, precise and methodical. He will be a good mathematician with competence on calculations. He will have much forethought, persistence and reasoning ability. Venus conjoined with Uranus can give one the desire to learn astrology. A few may have titles conferred on them, if Venus and Uranus receive good aspects from Saturn, Moon and Jupiter. Good aspect to Jupiter from other planets removes worries and allows one to pray to God. One can have the divine grace and intuition. In Horasara, Prithuyasas says that the person at whose birth Moon occupies Cancer (Kataka) will be an astrologer. It does not mean that all Cancer borns will learn astrology or at least have faith in astrology. Here one is to combine the Western System of prediction and find out the aspect that is being formed between the position of Moon at birth in Cancer and that of Saturn, Mercury and Uranus in the chart. If Uranus were to form adverse aspects with Moon, one will be perverted. If Mercury afflicts Moon, one will utter falsehood or whatever one tries to predict will not come true, especially when the period one runs, is governed by Moon and Mercury. Moon afflicted by Saturn does not allow one to concentrate nor will he have self-confidence but be diffident. Vaidyanatha Dikshitha, in Jataka Parijatham, mentions that people born in the years Prabhava and Kalayukthi will be proficient in astrology. Also, those born in Sathayam or Sathabheeshaik Nakshatra and those born in Sakuna Karana will be astrologers. Here also, one is to take that all people born either in Prabhava or Kalayukthi year or Sathabhishak Star or Sakuna Karana, unless they have good aspects among Moon, Mercury, Saturn and Uranus, cannot learn astrology and predict correctly. Mahadeva, in Jataka Tatva, has said that people having Venus and Mercury in the 2nd or the 3rd house, or people having Mercury in 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 or 11th house, or people born in Gemini, having exalted Jupiter and those who have the lord of the second house in good strength will be good astrologers. Even though in the majority of cases these rules will come true, yet, due to other evil aspects, a few may not have any desire to learn astrology and a few may even ridicule it due to the affliction.
Often wise people say, "Gathanu Gathiko Lokaha Na Lokaha Pararharthikaha", by that, they mean that one should not blindly follow the rules expounded but take pains to find out the truth and understand their spirit. This is strictly followed by the author. Therefore, it is necessary for one to take all these into consideration to find out whether the planetary aspects are beneficial to learn astrology and then decide who can make the best use of it by consulting learned and wise astrologers. Editing and predicting are different. Prediction is the real problem. Editing is not difficult. If Jupiter, Mercury and Mars have favourable aspects one can edit and publish, because Jupiter's aspect to Mercury produces journalists who need command of language, a somewhat encyclopedic range of knowledge and deep knowledge of one particular subject. It is desirable to have a delicate touch on the pulse of the public. Jupiter assists in rendering the matter in the publication suited to the needs of the readers and makes it popular. If the editor keenly desires to impart information of an educative type, Mercury should be favourable and strong. If Mercury and Mars form evil aspects, the editor will like to fight, if not in reality, yet in words. If both the planets occupy favourable signs, then the capacity for satire will be a useful asset to him. Mars forming good aspect with Mercury gives good humour and be fortunate to own a Press, as Mars indicates machinery and Mercury, paper, news, etc. Guru's beneficial aspect increases the income, improves the standard, expand the business, increases the circulation and makes the book popular. Saturn's aspect will restrict the activities and increase the debts. Further, there will be labour trouble or the release of the books will be unduly delayed and people will get vexed and dejected. Neptune's evil aspect shows that every venture will be started in a flash which will soon end in a crash. Lords of 2, 9 and 11 forming good aspects mutually among themselves and with the great benefic Jupiter will offer the most desirable results to the astrologer and to the consultant.

## Twelve Signs of the Zodiac - Their Classification and Their Influence
The circle of space surrounding the Earth and measuring 360 degrees of celestial longitude is referred to as the Zodiac. It is an imaginary belt in the Heavens, 15 degrees wide in which the planets travel. It is the path in the middle of which the Sun appears to move around the Earth, called the Ecliptic.

The Zodiac is divided into 12 equal parts. They are: 1. Aries - Mesha, 2. Taurus - Rishaba, 3. Gemini - Mithuna, 4. Cancer - Kataka, 5. Leo - Simha, 6. Virgo - Kanni, 7. Libra - Thulam, 8. Scorpio - Vrischika, 9. Sagittarius - Dhanus, 10. Capricorn - Makara, 11. Aquarius - Kumba, 12. Pisces - Meena. Each of these is a solar mansion, otherwise called a sign or a rasi, and each extends to exactly 30 degrees. Each sign has derived its name from its resemblance to the group of constellations found in and around the Zodiac.

These signs may be classified broadly into thirteen groups depending on their influences on animate and inanimate objects. They are: (1) Positive and Negative Signs, (2) Northern and Southern Equinoctial, Tropical Signs, (3) Fiery, Earthy, Airy and Watery Signs, (4) Movable, Fixed and Common Signs, (5) Fruitful or Barren Signs, (6) Mute Signs, (7) Violent Signs, (8) Human Signs, (9) Voice Signs, (10) Bestial or Four-Legged Signs, (11) Dual Signs, (12) Bicorporal or Double-Bodied Signs, and (13) Short and Long Ascension Signs.

### Positive and Negative Signs
The signs from Aries (Mesha) onwards are alternatively positive and negative. They are sometimes referred to as masculine (or day signs) and feminine (or night signs) respectively. Thus, the odd signs namely, Aries (Mesha), Gemini (Mithuna), Leo (Simha), Libra (Thulam), Sagittarius (Dhanus) and Aquarius (Kumba) are positive (or masculine); the even signs viz., Taurus (Rishabha), Cancer (Kataka), Virgo (Kanya), Scorpio (Vrischika), Capricorn (Makara) and Pisces (Meena) are negative (or feminine).

The positive signs denote an assertive, bold, expressive, active and offensive nature. They give determination, power of will and force. On the other hand, the negative signs show a passive, receptive, defensive and a somewhat conciliatory disposition. There is a tendency for the positive signs to be more self-expressive and less passive in their reactions and for the negative signs to be more self-repressive and less outgoing and spontaneous.

A positive sign as Ascendant indicates that the native is more generally fortunate in their undertakings than a negative sign does. The negative signs are weak and feminine on account of passive qualities. If the lagna falls in a male sign and other testimonies also support, then even a lady born in a modest family will have masculine appearance and qualities. But if the lagna falls in a male sign occupied by feminine planets or if the lord of lagna occupies a female sign, they may be a male with feminine qualities, appearance and character, etc.

If the sign on the cusp of the 5th house falls in a masculine sign; if the 5th lord is a masculine planet and is in a masculine sign, etc., most of the offspring will be boys. If these happen to be feminine, then the offspring will be girls. This is a general rule. Positive signs on the cusp of the ascendant give vitality, negative signs are not so vigorous, unless a strong masculine planet is very near the cusp of the Ascendant.

### Northern and Southern Signs
The first six signs of the Zodiac, namely, Mesha, Rishaba, Mithuna, Kataka, Simha, and Kanya (i.e., Aries to Virgo) are called Northern signs, as they are to the north of the celestial Equator (they are in the northern hemisphere). The remaining six signs, that is, Thulam, Vrischikam, Dhanus, Makara, Kumba, and Meena (Libra to Pisces) are to the south of the celestial Equator (in the southern hemisphere) and are so termed southern signs.

### Equinoctial Signs
Equinox means equal day and night. When the Sun is in the intersecting point of the celestial Equator and the Ecliptic, where Aries commences and Pisces ends, and the point of intersection is at the end of Virgo and the beginning of Libra, then the days and nights are equal all over the world. This phenomenon occurs only twice a year, around 21st March and 23rd September. Mesha (Aries) and Thulam (Libra) are hence the two equinoctial signs. Mesha (Aries) is the vernal equinoctial sign and Thulam (Libra) the autumnal equinoctial sign.

### Tropical Signs
Cancer (Kataka) and Capricorn (Makara) are the two tropical signs. They are sometimes referred to as the summer solstitial sign and winter solstitial sign, respectively. The days are the longest when the Sun is in the initial point of Cancer, and the nights are the longest when the Sun is in the beginning of Capricorn. According to the Sayana system, the Sun enters Capricorn on or around the 22nd of December every year. However, the dates are different according to the Nirayana system, which uses a fixed zodiac.

### The Zodiacal Signs and Their Corresponding Elements
The zodiacal signs are classified into four groups or triplicities according to the four elements: fire, earth, air, and water. These elements symbolize spiritual, physical, mental, and psychic processes in humans. The four groups are as follows:

Fire: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius
Earth: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn
Air: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius
Water: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces

### Fiery Signs
The fiery signs represent the vital spirit, including activity. They tend to an assertive, independent, courageous, and enthusiastic nature. They signify activity and ambition, vigour and vitality, energy and push. When fiery signs are on the cusp of the ascendant, the disposition is said to be proud, enterprising, and commanding, with more desire to lead than to serve. The native may be argumentative and self-confident, with an aspiring, acute, and penetrating mind. They will not relish the suggestions offered by others and will act on their own impulses. A spiritual bent of mind is also denoted.

Fiery signs as Ascendant cause fevers and inflammatory disorders, usually acute but lasting only for a short duration. According to Westerners, if the majority of planets occupy fiery signs, it shows ingenuity, force, and energy, and fits the native to study mechanics and to follow any trade or profession in which metals and fire play a part, such as those of soldiers, mechanics, engineers, smiths, barbers, butchers, surgeons, and other hazardous and dangerous vocations. Planets in these signs are more active than in others.

Leo has stated that fiery signs are connected with vitality and vital force; earthy signs with the physical body; airy signs with the nervous system, brain, and mind generally; and watery signs with the etheric double - the finer mould into which the physical system was cast at birth.

### Earthy Signs
Earthy signs show solidity and stability, indicating material welfare and a tendency to seek power and position. If rising, they also give good health. People with a majority of planets in earthy signs tend to be careful and cautious, premeditative, prudent, practical, secretive, suspicious, stubborn, self-protective, slow and steady, reserved, restrained, methodical, economical, plodding, and persevering. Their minds are practical, objective, scientific, methodical, and materialistic.

Business is often the best option for those with a majority of planets in earthy signs. According to Mr. L. George, these signs are associated with a nervous temperament, restlessness, worry, and agitation, as well as a predisposition to rheumatic and windy complaints and chronic disorders.

Earthy signs may lead to occupations connected with agriculture, horticulture, gardening, land, mines, timber, building materials, contracting, foodstuffs (raw and cooked), grocery business, restaurants, grain dealing, dress goods, and clothing.

### Airy Signs
Airy signs are distinctly connected with mental and mental experiences. If well connected, they indicate less vitality, but show cheerful, gentle, amiable, courteous, sympathetic, refined, and human nature. They offer good intellect, a fertile imagination, and an idealistic and artistic nature. People born in airy signs will be well-informed and wide-awake workers, with active circulation and plump bodies.

Professions that require more mental and brain activity than physical activity are best suited for people born in airy signs. These include accountants, bookkeepers, poets, novelists, lawyers, artists, reporters, lecturers, scientists, aviators, inventors, etc. The majority of planets in airy signs show that the native is talented, refined, courteous, idealistic, and often inconstant. They will be artistic and literary-minded. However, due to overwork, they may suffer from nervous troubles.

### Watery Signs Signify Fertile Imagination

Watery signs signify a fruitful nature and give enough of fertile imagination. They show less recuperative power and the constitution will be weak. The disposition is timid, inert, and unwilling to act. The mind is receptive, contemplative, sensitive, sentimental, and psychic. Occult tendencies are indicated.

Alan Leo says as follows: "The watery signs are the least fortunate, giving sensitiveness and often lack of energy. When the majority of the planets occupy watery signs, the native is shy, sensitive, timid, psychic and often lacks energy. The watery signs, if afflicted, make one anaemic and weak pulsed. In later stages, tumour or cancerous growths may trouble them. Watery signs, if rising, give much less stamina and predispose to digestive, urinary and catarrh troubles.

Watery signs favour all employments in which liquid is used, including mineral water, wines and spirits, washing clothes, sailing, emotional acting, elocution, soft goods, textiles, fabrics, chemists, and more. A majority of planets in watery signs denotes a psychic or emotional nature; the instinctive consciousness is very keen; the native is more or less receptive or impressionable; often mediumistic and sometimes passionate.

### The Qualities of Movable, Fixed, and Common Signs
Each category of the four signs (such as movable, fixed, and common) has a common factor or quality of expression, but this quality in each sign is applied differently. The three qualities may be compared to the three Gunas of Hindus, viz., the cardinal or movable to Rajas (activity), the fixed to Tamas (constancy), and the mutable or common to Sattva (rhythm). Mesha, Kataka, Thulam, and Makara are movable signs; Rishaba, Simha, Vrischika, and Kumbha are fixed ones; and Mithuna, Kanya, Dhanus, and Meena are common signs.

### Movable Signs
Movable signs represent movement from one place to another, just as water in the river flows smoothly without going back to its source. They show enterprise, enthusiasm, love of ambition, forcefulness, and go-ahead spirit; fame recognition and popularity; and ability to complete plans and execute them in a short time. The native always loves change and reform. They represent the busy people, the best businessmen, pioneers, those who rise in life on their own and those who make headway against heavy odds and impediments. The natives of movable signs are independent in spirit and self-assertive. They dislike dependence on others and are averse to subordination.

Movable signs on the Ascendant incline to ailments affecting the head, stomach, kidneys and all movable or functional disorders. They tend to brain fever, headache, fits, disorders of the stomach, kidney troubles, cold, rheumatism, injuries to the head and knees, etc. Afflictions from movable signs indicate acute ailments which usually run their course and leave no particular trace.

Movable signs on the cusp of the 2nd house help one to earn money through name, fame and public recognition. The natives of these signs have great vitality and dynamism so much so that they gain through activity, ambition and adventures. There is the liability to fluctuating fortune and changes where money is concerned. Speculative enterprise is favoured and acquisitiveness is usually well developed.

If the third house cusp falls in a movable sign, it signifies that the mind is often aspiring, active, ambitious, enterprising but changeable. One will love change and like travels. He will do a lot of traveling about. Close ties with cousins, neighbours, etc., and with relatives in general are developed. Being possessed of dynamic energy, one will be able to take up pioneer work. The natives of these signs are ardent in whatever they undertake and if they once espouse a cause—social, political, religious or educational or any other—they will work for that cause with all the vim and vigor of their energetic nature. They succeed through sheer audacity.

The persons influenced by these signs are best fitted in positions that require speed and swiftness, wit and ingenuity and tact and diplomacy. They never rest content until they are in the lead of whatever pursuit they follow. They scorn subordination. These natives are ideally suited to occupy responsible and authoritative positions.

When, in a horoscope, the majority of the planets are placed in movable signs or when these signs are on the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses called angles or kendras, it shows that one will hold a prominent position, be it trade, business, politics or profession. He will exhibit ambition and enterprise to a great degree. They will never feel fully satisfied unless they are at the head of things. They are fond of changes in life and will have many changes too.

If Jupiter occupies the 11th house falling in a movable sign, it indicates executive ability and progress; if this happens to be a fixed sign, jealousy and pride among friends is the result; if it is a common sign, one may have friends who are scientifically inclined or religious minded. Also, one's friends may prove unreliable. Saturn placed in the 11th house in a fixed sign signifies that there will be delay and hindrance through friends. If the 11th cusp is in a common sign and Saturn is also there, one may not achieve one's hopes. There may also be sorrow through friends.

When the movable signs are on the angles (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses) one will be resourceful and alert. He would grasp an idea very quickly. Being enterprising and active, he will shun no effort in order to succeed. He will succeed in any enterprise, come what may. A brave, bold and indomitable spirit is indicated.

### Fixed Signs
The influence of the fixed signs rouses the desire nature, giving stamina and persistence in action. People of these signs have a very strong and determined will. They are pre-eminently thorough. If they make up their mind to do something, they will keep on working with remarkable patience and persistence until success comes to them. They are very practical in their approach. They will not mind doing anything for one who has won their affection. They are very firm in their mental attitude and once an opinion has been formed, they cling to it with tenacity. They are very difficult people to convince, but when once won over to a cause, they will defend it to the last.

Those influenced by the fixed signs will be outspoken, self-reliant, and reliable, and remarkably patient. On the other side, they are obstinate, rigid, dogmatic, unrelenting, and unbending. They will persist in a given direction and neither reason nor argument will turn them. Their tendency is to seek solitude and become self-absorbed. These people are endowed with good executive ability. The natives with the fixed sign are very fond of comfort, luxury, and other refining influences of life.

Fixed signs tend to ailments affecting the heart and the generative system. Chronic or organic troubles are threatened. One may suffer from diseases like diphtheria, bronchitis, asthma, heart troubles, defective circulation, and spinal complaints. Afflictions from fixed signs denote that one may inherit hereditary diseases which usually become chronic.

Fixed signs bring the native gain through authoritative influence, investments, and accumulation of unearned income. There being no fluctuation denoted, one can expect to have a fixed income. If the third house falls in a fixed sign, then the native will have a fixed and rigid attitude. He will be persevering, plodding, painstaking, proud, and authoritative. He dislikes traveling; any travel is usually forced by circumstances. It favors government service and employment in ancient institutions and established businesses with security of service. One will achieve success through slow, steady, and sustained effort.

The fixed sign people grasp opportunities slowly. Being conservative-minded, they do not quickly respond to the new environment and care more for permanency and fixity. When fixed signs are on the cusps of the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th houses in a horoscope, or most of the planets are found in fixed signs, one will be firm, determined, dignified, and self-reliant. He will be slow and plodding but will succeed eventually. One will require time to come to a decision. "Patient persistence in every doing" is his motto. He is sure to rise in life through fixity of purpose and persistent effort. He will put his talent to the best use. Setbacks do not daunt him. He will adhere to a method only after being satisfied that it will meet his requirements. It is next to impossible to change him, but when veered round to a cause, he will prove to be its most ardent and reliable advocate.

### Common Signs: Characteristics and Effects
Common signs, which are dual and mutable, may be likened to a swinging pendulum. They represent the vibratory motion passing from one point to another and back again, linking the two extremes of its motion. Flexibility or plasticity is the predominant characteristic of these signs. People born in these signs or having a majority of the planets in these signs will often be inconstant, indecisive, vacillating, and restless. They are peaceful and sympathetic in their disposition and cordial and pleasing in their manner. They are averse to exerting their will power and often drift and dream of the future.

People with common signs are sensitive to and much swayed by their surrounding environment, as they lack the stamina to assert themselves. They are not capable of the slow and sustained work put forth by the fixed class, and get easily discouraged by difficulties. They are best suited to take up agencies, commission jobs, etc., in which much executive skill is not required. These signs bring income to one through service and ordinary means, but finance is prone to fluctuation. People of common signs are not capable of accumulating wealth, as they are lazy and indifferent.

Common signs incline to affections of the lungs, limbs, breathing apparatus, and all kinds of nervous disorders. These diseases are often convertible, and one may be able to overcome them entirely or they may become chronic depending on the individual's mental temperament. When common signs are connected with houses 2, 6, and 10, one is best fitted to serve others. When common signs are on the cusps of the angles (1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th houses in the chart) or when a number of planets are posited in these signs, the mind is often fickle, lightly superficial, wavering, and versatile. One may grasp an idea in a short time and arrive at a decision, but will change their decision quickly. They will succeed in life by other's aid, but not gain the required recognition for their merit and labour. If the 1st and 7th lords are in harmonious aspect or in parivartana (mutual exchange), partnership is advisable; a good mutual working arrangement is indicated. If the cusp of the 11th house and the lord of 11 is in common signs, one will acquire doubtful friendships.

### Fruitful Signs
Cancer (Kataka), Scorpio (Vrischika), and Pisces (Meena) are said to be fruitful in nature, with all watery signs being fruitful. Taurus (Rishaba), Libra (Thulam), Capricorn (Makara), and Sagittarius (Dhanus) are said to be semi-fruitful. Fruitful signs in the cusps of the 5th and 7th houses and their lords in fruitful signs indicate an early union. Barren signs in the cusps of the 5th and 1st houses indicate that the native is not likely to marry in time (provided other testimonies also point to the same view). Fruitful signs covering the 11th and 5th houses and the lords of 5 and 11 in fruitful signs promise progeny. Barren signs in the cusps of the 1st, 5th, and 11th or the lords of these in barren signs lessen chances of children.

### Barren Signs
Aries (Mesha), Gemini (Mithuna), Leo (Simha), and Virgo (Kanya) are called barren or sterile signs. These are not fruitful. Barren signs on the cusps of the 5th and 11th house (11th house being 5th to the partner), the lords of these not fruitful signs, Moon not in a fruitful sign, the lagna not a fruitful sign, the lord of lagna not occupying a fruitful sign, and no fruitful planet in the 5th or 11th houses are indications of no children.

### Mute Signs
All watery signs (namely, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces) are mute signs. If Mercury, being the lord of the 6th house, is in the 2nd house in a mute sign or the lord of the 6th house is in the 2nd house in a mute sign and afflicted by Mars or Saturn, a perceptible stammer, lisp, or other impediment will be the result. Mercury anywhere in a mute sign afflicted by Saturn causes stammering. If Mars adds his influence by a bad aspect, then the native will talk very quickly, lisp, or pronounce their words badly. When Mercury is in a mute sign in opposition to the Moon, the native will have a defect in their speech. Saturn in the ascendant in a mute sign causes an impediment in speech. The 2nd house governs the vocal organs. If a voice sign is found in the 2nd house in a horoscope, more especially if Venus or Mercury is therein free from affliction, then eloquence or some vocal gift may be predicted. Jupiter indicates that one will offer advice, preach (though they may not practice), and will be a platform speaker. Mars and Jupiter give assertion and make them an orator who can move the masses with their fiery speech. Mercury and Saturn show that they will modify their speech according to the time, circumstances, and the crowd before them.

### Violent Signs
Aries (Mesha) and Scorpio (Virschika) are said to be violent signs. They know "no fear"; they undertake all enterprises with courage and confidence. They are best suited to take risks.

### Human Signs
Gemini (Mithuna), Virgo (Kenya), Aquarius (Kumbha), and the first half of Sagittarius (Dhanus) are called human or humane signs, as these are depicted by human figures on the symbolic globe. Some authors consider Libra (Thulam) to also be humane. Prithyusaa says in Horasara Adhyaya I in Sloka 1 I, that these signs are strong when the lagna falls in one of these signs. "Whoever does not have the predominant planets of their nativity in human signs will be little sociable and not very humane". If the ascendant or principal significators are not in human signs, the native themselves will be estranged from human nature.

### Voice Signs
Gemini (Mithuna), Libra (Thulam) and Aquarius (Kumbha), which are airy signs, are also referred to as musical or voice signs. Some Western authors consider Virgo (Kanya) and Sagittarius (Dhanus) to also be voice signs. Some even include Taurus (Rishaba).
For there to be a voice, there must be an airy medium. This is why all airy signs are considered to be voice signs.

### Bestial Signs
Mesha (Ram), Rishaba (Bull), Simha (Lion), Makara (Goat) and the second half of Dhanus are symbolized by the figures of animals whose names they bear. These are known as the bestial or four-legged signs. According to Prithyusas, these signs are said to be strong when the Meridian (10th house) falls in them. Those born when these signs ascend are said to have the qualities of such animals, such as being bold like the lion or lustful like the goat.

### Dual Signs
Gemini (Mithuna), Sagittarius (Dhanus), and Pisces (Meena) are called twin signs or dual signs, meaning plurality.

### Bicorporal or Double-Bodied Signs
Gemini (Mithuna), which represents a boy and a girl, is one half of Dhanus, which represents a bow and an arrow, and Meena, which represents two fishes bound together by a cord, are the bicorporal or double-bodied signs.

### Signs of Short and Long Ascension
Makara, Kumba, Meena, Mesha, Rishaba, and Mithuna are termed "short ascension signs" because they ascend in a short time. The other six signs take a longer time to ascend and are termed "long ascension signs".

### Signs of Long Ascension
In the Northern Hemisphere, the six signs of Kataka, Simha, Kanya, Thulam, Vrischika, and Dhanus take longer to ascend than the other six signs, and are thus termed as long ascension signs. For places in the Southern Hemisphere, this must be reversed, with the signs of long ascension in the Northern Hemisphere being short ascension signs in the Southern Hemisphere.

## What the Twelve Signs Signify
The physical features, characteristics, marks, health, finance, and profession indicated by each sign are dealt with in general. Planets occupying these signs will modify these results. Only when there is no planet in the sign can the effect of these be noticed without any deviation. The qualities of the sign will be manifest all the more if its lord were also to be posited therein. Like a coin which has two different sides, each sign presents two characteristics - good and bad. Depending on other factors, these characteristics will be modified. Benefics like Jupiter and Venus in the Ascendant mitigate the evil and offer more agreeable results. Malefics like Saturn and Mars in the Ascendant spoil the good nature and bring out the worst qualities into action. Similarly, the general physical features indicated by each sign may vary from the normal, due largely to the planets occupying the sign.

### Aries - Mesha
Aries - Mesha is the first or head sign of the Zodiac. It commences at the vernal equinox and extends up to exactly 30 degrees. Aries is an equinoctial sign. It is fiery and hot by nature, termed bestial and sterile. It is a movable or cardinal sign, masculine or positive, and is of short ascension. Aries is generally symbolized by a Ram, being in nature rash, combative, lascivious, springy, and hardy. It is called an Oriental sign denoting the beginning of the Right Ascension. Aries represents head and face in the human body and is ruled by Mars. The Sun is exalted in this sign, while Saturn is debilitated and Venus is said to be in its fall in this sign, as it is the 7th sign opposing Libra owned by Venus. According to the Sayana system, the Sun enters Aries on 21st or 22nd March, while according to the Nirayana system, the Sun enters on 13th or 14th April.

Physical Appearance

Persons born under this sign are of middle stature, with a lean and muscular body, neither stout nor thick. Their complexion is ruddy and they have a fairly long neck and face. Their head is broad at the temples and narrow at the chin, with bushy eyebrows, eyes grey to greyish brown with sharp sight, and wiry hair varying from dark to sandy.

Mental Tendencies

As Mars rules this sign, the people born in Aries will be ever active and ambitious, bold and impulsive. If the ascendant is afflicted, they will be rash and aggressive, but beneficial aspects give them confidence and courage. They always aim high and are ever enterprising.

Characteristics

Aries, being the first sign of the zodiac, persons born under this sign will desire to be at the head of all affairs. They do not relish suggestions from others but act only according to their own judgment. They do not like subordination but wish to be the leaders in thought and action. They are best fitted to guide, control, and govern others if the ascendant receives beneficial aspects. Being a positive sign, it gives determination and force of character. Arians act quickly with unbounded self-confidence. They have much of executive ability and uncompromising spirit. Being born in a movable sign, they will not hesitate to change whatever they dislike and whenever they want. They cannot wait patiently for opportunities to come but will go out and create them to fulfill their desire. As Aries is a fiery sign, their mind will be pregnant with ideas and their desire will be to execute them at once. They are best fitted to deal with any situation or emergency. They can never sacrifice their personal desires for others. If the sign is afflicted, the Aries born will be drawn into a quarrel and if they do not fare well, they become fretful and boisterous. They will try to stick to their own views, under-estimate others, be over-optimistic, overshoot the mark, and over-trade in business. They are not the people who look before they leap. Consistency is not their virtue. They will take up fresh enterprises before completing those on hand. Even if they occupy a humble and subordinate position, they will try to be at the head of some branch of their work. Very quickly they scheme, plan, and execute with the ultimate object of directing others. If Aries is afflicted, the native's enthusiasm is converted into fanaticism, and boldness into foolhardiness. They are ardently demonstrative and passionate. Evil planets in the ascendant make them aggressive, proud, arrogant, headstrong, hasty, and quarrelsome. They will be egoistic with the 'I' predominating in them. They are tenacious and purposeful, with their accent on the ends and not on the means.

Health and Disease

Generally, people born under the sign of Aries will enjoy good health. They will have a strong immunity to and resistance against infectious diseases, as Mars rules the sign. However, they are prone to minor injuries and serious accidents, particularly to the head, so they should exercise caution when engaging in activities that involve risk, such as driving cars or working with sharp instruments. Both men and women born in this sign will be fond of sports, as they are capable of sudden spurts of energy. They are better suited for games that last only a few minutes than for matches that last for a long duration.  
Aries indicates the head, and the sixth house from it is Virgo, which denotes the digestive system and the type of ailments that Aries-born people are likely to suffer from. These include headaches, burns, inflammatory diseases, affections of the brain, neuralgia, coma, high fever, colic pains, paralysis, apoplexy, pimples, insomnia, ringworms, migraine, smallpox, malaria, affections of the brain, thrombosis, etc. To maintain good health, Aries-born people should get plenty of rest and sleep, eat good food with plenty of vegetables, relax, and control their feelings. They should also avoid worry, excitement, and anger. As a patient, the native becomes impatient of sickness and tries to have a quick recovery. They should also avoid stimulants and eat less meat.  
Aries indicates the bones of the skull and face, except the nasal one, as well as the muscles such as occipitals, deprimens articularum, buccinator, frontals, attolens, temporates, and zygomaticus. It also represents the internal carotids and temporal carotids arteries, as well as the cephalic veins.  

Finance and Fortune

Though people born in this sign are not inclined to amass wealth, they still have a desire to earn a lot and spend accordingly. They may lose money through impulsive purchases and rash investments, as they tend to think only of the present and not of the future. If there are evil planets in Aries, they may start something in a flash and end in a crash. To avoid this, they should think before they act and balance their budgets.

Romance and Marriage

Arians are very frank and enthusiastic in love. Their good nature and charm attract the opposite sex, and they take practical steps to pursue their interests. They want freedom, adventure, and everlasting affection in love. To be happy, they should soften their dominant nature and not be impatient or emotional. They should also stick with their old lover.  
Aries wives will be witty and independent. If Aries is afflicted, they will have pride in their appearance and in their domestic environment. They will always speak highly of their own family. Jealousy and pride are their outstanding weaknesses, and they will expect their husbands to attend to them, speak highly of them, and never praise anyone else, especially in their presence. They will prove to be good hosts, and they will only love a man whom they can admire. If an Aries lady marries a simple man, she will overpower and subdue him in all activities. Therefore, husbands should be patient and tactful when dealing with them. Aries women become very romantic and are prone to sudden spurts of enthusiasm. Husbands born under Leo or Sagittarius will be able to cope with Aries ladies, while Libra-borns will tone down the fiery nature of Aries natives and purchase peace at any price.  
Aries husbands will prove to be desirable partners. They usually choose beautiful, clever, and good wives. When in a good mood, they will be generous and bountiful. However, they may make impulsive purchases on credit without any planning or money on hand. Therefore, those who marry Aries-borns should always save a portion of what the husbands give them.  

Domestic Environment

People born in Aries love their home and family. They strive to keep their house neat and tidy and are excellent hosts. They have many friends who often visit and keep them cheerful.

Profession

Aries indicates professions that are ruled by Mars. If the planet that denotes one's profession by owning either the 2nd, 6th, or 10th house in one's horoscope occupies Aries in Rasi, or if the lord of the house occupies Aries in Navamsa, or if Aries happens to be the second, sixth, or tenth house and the lord Mars is very strong, then the native may pursue any of the following professions: army officers, captains in the army or navy, soldiers, defense department, surgeons, butchers, barbers, police, A.R.P. officials, chemists, bailiffs, thieves, smiths, tailors, cutlers, bakers, armorers, watchmakers, dyers, cooks, carpenters, gamesters, gunners, physicians, boxers, workers in iron and steel, officers of law, firemen, guards, detectors, mechanics, wrestlers, workers in lime and brick kilns, dealers in sports goods, writers, workers in factories, industry, and mills, etc.

### Taurus (Rishaba)
Taurus is the second sign of the zodiac and extends from 30 degrees of the Vernal Equinox (or Mesha) to 60 degrees. It is contained in the Karthikai Nakshathra (or constellation) in the second, third, and fourth padas (quarters), and in the Rohini Nakshathra in full and the first and second padas of Mrigasirisha. Taurus is an earthy, fixed, feminine, moist, semi-fertile, bestial sign of short ascension. It is symbolized by a bull, both by Hindus and Westerners, with unusual horns on its head and toes, and a decisive and determined look to go ahead and rush forward with great energy, showing its stubborn and tenacious nature.  
A few thousand years ago, the Egyptians celebrated the May Day festival, likely due to the entrance of the Sun into Taurus, which is referred to as "The Sacred Bull," and when the Vernal Equinox coincided with the commencement of Taurus. The May Day festival with its Maypole and garlands may be their remains. Taurus is governed by Venus (Sukra), who is said to be the owner of this sign. It is also the sign where the Moon is exalted. As Taurus is the seventh sign from Scorpio, ruled by Mars (Mangal-Kuja-Sevvai-Angaraka), it is the house of detriment to Mars. The fiery nature of Mars is toned down by the passionate and peaceful Venus (Sukra).  

Physical Features

People with Taurus as their sign typically have a middle stature, a plump body, a broad forehead, a thick and stout neck, bright eyes, dark hair, a clear complexion, and are solidly built and stocky with big shoulders and well-developed muscles.

Characteristics

Taurus is the first of the earthy triplicity and the first of the fixed signs. Being earthy by nature, Taureans can put up with a lot of provocation and are known for their patience. When provoked to anger, however, they become wild with rage and can be dangerous like an earthquake. They are slow and steady, plodding and persevering, patient and persistent, enduring and executive, and conservative. They have a strong will and are determined and dogmatic. When this house is afflicted, they may have vices such as laziness and self-indulgence.  
Taureans have a sharp eye on their money and worldly possessions, and an impelling appetite for food. They concentrate their thoughts and have immense power and will. They prefer ease, comfort, and feasts, and live in their feelings rather than in their minds.  
As Venus rules this sign, the person will be ambitious and cheerful, ever smiling, and highly diplomatic. They may come upon a legacy at any part of their life, and be blessed with ornaments, costly jewels, gems, furniture, conveyance, comforts, estates, and gardens. They prefer solitude and rural life if Saturn lends its assistance. They are straightforward and natural, and do not jump to conclusions without considering the pros and cons. They are not verbose, and hold fast to their own opinions. They need more speed to cope with majority of their work without mulling matters over and over again. In love affairs, they will remain loyal and true to the one they like, even in the face of opposition. They have a taste in arts, music, sculpture, cinema, drama, etc., and know the value of money. They need to lead a temperate life.  

Weakness

One should not be so obstinate, nor slow, in action. Also one should not be so selfish nor vindictive by retaining anger for a very long time.

Health

Normally, those born under the sign of Taurus have robust health. They appear to have superhuman strength and are best adapted for mechanical and laborious pursuits. They appear to have an overabundance of life rather than a deficiency of it, and are less sensitive to pain. If they fall ill, they suffer for a long time without revealing it, and their recuperative powers are not satisfactory, leading to a slow recovery.

Disease

Generally, when Taurus is afflicted, one suffers from tonsils, diphtheria, pyorrhoea, or from the affections of the throat, palate, and neck. They may also suffer from colds and apoplexy, as well as constipation and plethora as they age. As Taurus denotes the throat, it is the part of the body most susceptible to illness. Pimples in the face and eye-sores also give trouble.

Finance

Patience and perseverance pay off for those born under the sign of Taurus. They are cautious when spending, especially when in need, and when they have made their fortune, they spend to their satisfaction while keeping a portion in reserve. They do not squander unnecessarily and have the gambling temperament. As Saturn owns the most favourable houses nine and ten, they are able to accumulate and hoard money, and they are able to get money for others, making them suitable for roles such as brokers and underwriters. They are practical and build their fortune on a steady, firm, and reinforced foundation, and measure their success by their savings.

Profession of Those Born in Taurus

As those born in Taurus desire to be comfortable and enjoy life to the full, they always go in for the best-paid profession. They have a great liking for trading in luxury goods, as Venus rules this sign. They deal in furs, cosmetics, scents, costly jewels and gems. As it is the second sign of the Zodiac and the second house indicates finance, they may be bankers, or part of a company's management. Stockbrokers, treasurers, cashiers, speculators, gamblers, and race-goers are mostly born in Taurus.  
As Rishaba is said to be the sign of agriculture (Krishi), they may be agriculturists, farmers, gardeners, nursery owners, etc. Venus being the chief governor for music, pleasure, and social success, they will be excellent musicians, actors, film producers, and owners of theatres. Also, bill collectors, employees in the revenue or agricultural department, bookbinders, dressmakers, tailors, chemists, printers, decorators, insurance agents, bus owners, taxi permits, and automobile transport owners are governed by Taurus. Those who deal in flowers, mirrors, glasses, mica, plastic, rubber, rice, cows, cattle, milk, dairy farms, ice cream, parlours, silk, cotton, vegetables, petrol, sugarcane, and sugar are also those born with that planet which indicates their profession of Taurus.  
As Venus is a feminine planet and the sign Taurus is also feminine, one may be employed in a girl's school and ladies' club, law court, income tax department, sales tax department, etc. Dealings in earrings, rings, watches, insulators, hats, shoes, leather, hides and skins, leather pocketbooks, purses, travelling bags, necklaces, garlands, and canes are indicated by Venus.  
When so many modes of earnings are attributed to Taurus, it is left to the ingenuity of the astrologer to judge by considering the other aspects; for instance, one is to consider which planet occupies Taurus; which aspects the sign, or the lord of the sign, Venus, etc. For example, he who supplies boiling milk will have Mars and the sign Taurus in any manner connected, so that Taurus denotes cow, Moon milk, and Mars the fiery planet to boil it. But he who deals with ice cream will have Saturn and Moon connected with Taurus or Venus, its lord, so that Venus denotes cow, Moon milk, and the cold binding planet cools down and brings out ice cream. Venus denotes silk; Venus and Sun indicate silk with lace. Venus and Mars show dealers in rayon; Venus with Mercury indicates cloth merchants. Saturn shows mineral products; Moon and Saturn denote kerosene as Moon is watery; Venus, Moon, and Saturn indicate petrol as Venus shows refinement and is also the chief governor for motor cars, etc.  
Venus is Tejas; beauty and skin. Saturn is for hair growth. Sun for wool; Mars for industry. Venus and Saturn show that one will deal in skins and hides as Saturn is the chief governor for longevity and indicates the dead. So, Saturn and Venus indicate dead skin. Mars indicates industry. If Venus were to be in the twelfth house, then dealings in shoes is to be predicted as the 12th house shows foot. Footwear dealers will have Venus, Saturn, and Mars as the planets indicating profession. If Venus is connected with the second house, it denotes money purse; the third house shows handbag.    
Venus, Saturn, and Mercury show that the native will deal in exports and imports of leather goods. If Sun also has any connection with them, he will deal in woolen goods, carpets, etc. Venus is for scents and for beauty; if Venus is connected with Moon, he will deal in scents and scented oils. If Venus and Moon receive an aspect from Mars, the native may manufacture scented soaps. If Sun is also connected, it indicates medicated soaps. If Venus and Mars alone are connected, they show scented powders. Venus, Sun, and Moon denote Anjan for the eye or eyetex. Venus, Mars, and Moon in the third and twelfth houses indicate the fancy colours in liquid used to polish the nails like Cutex.    
Planets in Taurus indicating vehicle show that he will have a four-legged vehicle; Mars suggests that it will be run by motor; i.e., there is mechanical contrivance; Saturn or Lord of 6 connected with the planets indicating profession and Taurus show that he will be a taxi driver.  
In this manner, one is to analyse and judge. Whatever profession they are, they will prove to be good administrators, maintaining discipline and controlling others. They are hard to budge if they once make a decision; they will go ahead even though there may be opposition. If they have partners in business, it is advisable that the partners do not confront them with fresh ideas suddenly, off and on. They (the partners of Taurus born) should wait, select a time, and plant the seed. Carefully and cautiously, they have to impress on the mind of the Taureans; allow time for them to accept the idea slowly; then they themselves will come out with a little improvement or modification to the original idea, regard it as their own, and finally put the proposal into practice. In service, Taureans are found to be faithful to the end.

Domestic Environments

People born in Taurus are good providers and the women are good homemakers. There will be a happy and harmonious life, with comfort, rest, and peace at home. They have a strong affinity for their native land and are attracted to its scenery. Peace, pleasure, prosperity, property, popularity, and position mean a lot to them. Taureans are known to supply sumptuous food and give feasts to others. If they are not served similarly by their guests, they cannot tolerate it. They decorate their house, keep their furniture and other items tidy, and maintain their home in good condition.

Marriage and Married Life

People born in Taurus are not generally impulsive and take a long time to make a decision when it comes to selecting a partner in life. Once they decide that a particular individual is ideal, they will stick to it and will not rest until they are successful. Since the sign is an earthy one, those born in the other two earthy signs or in the three watery signs will prove to be good partners, contributing to peace and maintaining harmony, leading to a happy life. There may be romances for Taurus-borns; if they fall in love with someone, they are faithful to them to the last. Their emotions are deep and they do not like to quarrel, nor do they enjoy confusion. The men born in Taurus will have loving wives and the ladies born in this sign will have devoted husbands. Love is real to them and they will always fulfill their social and financial obligations. They will always be affectionate, warm, and ever-loving, responding to kind treatment and flattered by luxury. Divorce is rare and they will endure and suffer even untold miseries and never desert their partner. They will have a feeling that their partner must be sheltered, looked after, attended to, cared for, and protected under any circumstances.  
Taurus husbands adore their wives and do not mind taking all pains to supply them with whatever they want. They may have partners born in a higher rank and may not be related, as the lord of the seventh house is also the lord of the twelfth house. They are reliable, generous, and faithful and will never neglect their home. They want their wives to dress nicely and look attractive and never find their domestic life tiresome. They will never regret marriage and look back to their school days when they were bachelors and were free to do as they pleased.  
Taurus wives will behave both like a mother and a wife. They will appear to be reserved and calm and may doubt their husband's love and affection, but make no secret of their love. They will also be equally anxious to lead a happy, harmonious wedded life. They seem to care more for their homes than they do for themselves between husband and wife. They are more satisfactory and dutiful parents than they are as partners in life. The softer side of their nature endows them with a gentleness, a peacefulness, and a serenity which makes them the most desirable companions in any relationship of life. Their feelings are not easily hurt and do not find hasty or ill-timed expression.  

Children

Parents born in Taurus will appear to be strict with their children and may even appear to be tyrannical. However, their intentions are good and their children will, in the long run, realize it and be much benefited. Therefore, they are capable and conscientious parents who try to lead a noble family life. The children will always treat the parents with respect and bring them great pleasure and satisfaction. They will be well-built and intelligent.

Handwriting

As Taurus-borns have a great liking for beauty and art, due to Venus, their handwriting will be beautifully curved, small, and smooth. Being economical, they do not leave much space in between words or in between lines. They do not use offensive words and are always mild and gentle. Invariably, they put a full-stop after their signature and underline their signature with artistic hooks at both ends.

Day

Generally, Friday is their lucky day. Grand success can be expected on Wednesdays; Saturdays delay the results, but do not deny nor disappoint. Ultimately, on Saturdays, Taurus-borns will be crowned with success. Tuesdays show extravagant expenses. Thursdays denote gain through a partner. Mondays indicate a short journey and pleasant correspondence. Sundays show rest at home.

Character to be Corrected

The general indications of Taurus are dealt with in detail and are applicable only when the Taurus sign is not afflicted by any planet. However, if the birth-sign Taurus receives adverse aspects, the person will experience undesirable effects and results. To counteract this, it is necessary to cultivate certain virtues and try to avoid the evil effect.  
For instance, if Mars and Mercury afflict the ascendant Taurus, or Mars afflicts Mercury in Taurus or Mercury forms an evil aspect with Mars in Taurus, this makes one a criminal. Similarly, Saturn and Mercury give them the courage to commit forgery and cheat the bank. Saturn alone afflicting the ascendant makes the native lazy and lethargic, as they do not realise that life moves ever forward and they generally do not move along with it. As a result, they are soon out of step and out of tune.  
People born in Taurus, having these adverse aspects, must correct themselves in order to enjoy the real fruits of life in this world. The results mentioned above may be modified by the planets in each sign.  

### Gemini - Mithunam
Gemini is the third sign of the Zodiac, extending from the 60th degree from the Vernal Equinox (or Mesha 0 degree) to 90 degrees, and is thirty degrees in Longitude. Mrigasirisha third and fourth padas, Thiruvadhirai or Arudhra and Punarpushyam first, second and third padas are contained in this sign. Gemini is the first of the airy triplicity and also of the mutable signs. It is masculine and positive, and classified as a barren sign.  
Gemini is ruled by Mercury, an effeminate but intellectual planet. No planet gets either exaltation or debilitation in this sign, but Jupiter is said to be in its detriment in this sign as it is the house which opposes Sagittarius owned by Jupiter. To Saturn and Venus this sign is said to be friendly, and to the other planets it is considered to be the enemy's quarters.  

Physical Features

Gemini gives a tall, upright, straight body; the hands will be long. The legs will be thin and the veins will be visible. Complexion will be moderate, fair or dark, depending on the planet which rises then in Gemini at the time of birth. The eyes will be hazel and the look quick, sharp and active. Nose will be long.

Characteristics

Being an airy sign, persons born in this sign live mostly in the mind. They will be carefree and joyous and somewhat reluctant. Their mind will be positive and strong. They are versatile, restless and inclined to have changes often. As Mercury is the lord of the sign, one will be inclined to be reading, writing and corresponding often. They can understand people and adopt themselves readily to circumstances. They can offer advice, persuade and argue with others. They can explain the merits and demerits of a case, but they cannot command or manage successfully. Being a common sign and the third sign of the Zodiac, these persons will have a liking to travel frequently. These may be mainly short journeys by land. They are always active with a facile mind. They will always be considering the advantages and disadvantages of each case and hence decision will not be taken quickly.  
Gemini is termed as twins. Mercury, the lord of the sign is depicted as a boy, among all Gods, not full-grown. In the ancient symbolic pictures, the twins were brother and sister. Mercury is also said to be "The Winged Messenger of God". Mercury has both wings on its helmet and also sandals. That is why, Geminians are very quick. It is said that people with some important and big things to express, generally elect the time of Gemini as they have the faith that this sign will give sharp intelligence, adaptability and ultimately grand success.  
Being a dual sign, it gives the native the ability to follow more than one occupation at a time and also to adopt oneself to new surroundings. One should avoid going to extremes. Geminians may be impulsively generous at times and also parsimonious with others. They have to avoid superficiality. Then they will have insight and capacity more than enough to do any work intelligently. They will have dual experiences in their life. These people can be relied upon in any emergency as they can respond to the necessities and requirements of the moment. They have a few faults as waywardness, fickleness and leaving their work unfinished. They will take up some work and while they are doing it, they will go on to another which also they are apt to leave unfinished. Therefore, they can be at their best when they cooperate with others and undertake to do any job. The dual sign makes them both generous and niggardly. They will gather courage, present a courageous front and assertive attitude even though they are highly timid and nervous. It is very difficult for others to understand them and their peculiarities. They are rather impulsive. It is the impulse that will decide which line of action one will take. They can never stand any anxiety or worry. They love diversity; like the air to which they belong; they have to be moving from place to place or from one thought to the other. They refuse to be bound by rules and habits. They are pleased only when they act unexpectedly, rather than in accordance with convention.  
If Moon can be compared to a mirror, Mercury may be compared to a lens. Those who are governed by Moon will simply repeat what they have crammed. But Mercurians are persons revealing intellectual qualities and show all the signs of mental dexterity and supreme intelligence. They will understand, analyse, have a quick grasp with much retentive power and reproductive ability. Then mind will be logical and clear and they have quick mental action. They are always alert for any new idea and fresh interest. They are quick-witted and clever. The house, Gemini, is called the house of oscillation and vacillation. So these persons are changeable. They are apt to diffuse their energies and spread their action on diverse subjects.  
Being an airy sign ruled by Mercury (Budha), the native will be having much of curiosity and will seek after facts. He will go deep into all matters as though he is doing research. He will prove to be a good detective, a brilliant journalist, and an excellent schemer. They have the talent for language and Gemini being an intellectual sign, they have no difficulty in remembering things. They cannot concentrate on one subject. It is said that the Geminans have too many irons in the fire. Their range of thought is very wide. If retrograde Mercury were also to rise at the time of birth, the native will prefer to sidestep the truth and enjoy a good joke. They cannot believe what they have not seen or experienced. Their viewpoint will always be reasonable. They can understand the other's outlook and adapt themselves to it. They are inclined to indulge in practical wit and ask many questions. They have an academic and teachable nature with a democratic attitude. They have a humane and genial personality with a fondness for good company. They can never remain in ignorance because they are not afraid of asking questions till they get a clear idea and understand it.  

Weakness

No one can do things more easily than the Geminians. None can do them more gracefully; and none can compete with them more successfully. But the weakness in them is they should have the deliberate determination to do their work and stick to it till it is completed. They lack concentration and quick decision. They should not give themselves up to petty strife. The defect in them is that they are always hasty and anxious to know the results then and there. Once they have planted the seeds, they do not give chance for them to nature. They will water and nurture them but they will often be digging them up to see how far they have progressed. The other peculiarity with them is that they want only short cuts. They are able to carry out work quickly adopting improved methods. Events will move faster in their life then in those of other persons.

What is wanted

They should take rest, take plenty of exercise, breathe plenty of fresh air, eat conservatively and cultivate physical and mental poise. They should have a definite aim in life and should stick to it. They should have a balanced outlook and should not be carried away by their own enthusiasm. They should have a sense of responsibility and should not be too much swayed by their emotions.

Health and Disease

Geminians are as active as their minds. They often spoil their health by unnecessary and unavoidable worry and anxiety. Their thin build and nervousness give the impression to others that their health is delicate like a barometer. If they avoid mental strain, their health will be normally good. They should not overtax themselves by undertaking a large variety of work. If they relax and get plenty of sleep, they can maintain good health.  
As Gemini rules over the lungs, all pulmonary affections are indicated by this sign, such as colds, runny noses, influenza, bronchitis, and tuberculosis. It also indicates shoulders and arms, and any defects in these parts are indicated by malefics in Gemini. As the sixth house from Gemini is Scorpio, people born in Gemini generally suffer from the diseases indicated by Scorpio, such as strangury, piles, fistula, affections of the bladder and excretory system, fever, and poisoning of the system. Therefore, if Gemini is afflicted, they will have defects in the pulmonary system, or they will have the diseases mentioned for Scorpio, as it is the house of diseases for Gemini-borns.  

Finance and Fortune

Geminians will experience both privation and plenty during their lifetime. There will be a lot of changes and they will enjoy life with good fortune or suffer continuous misfortune depending on the nature of their planets. There will be family disputes and they will not agree with their father. They may bring about their own downfall due to their secret connections to love affairs (if the planets Mars, Saturn, and Venus ruling the 6th, 8th, and 12th houses also contribute) and attachments, which will bring loss and difficulties. Some may have progeny through such connections, which will be a perennial source of trouble and headache.

Profession

Geminians are alert, active, and industrious, and they wish to have interesting and varied jobs. Their inquisitiveness, liking for talk, and sense of humour make them good speakers and ultimately bring them to the front of the public. They are capable brokers, intelligent agents, successful merchants, satisfactory secretaries, and efficient advocates. They can read the minds of their customers and know what they like and what they discard. Fully aware of their likes and dislikes, they can sell articles at a good profit, convincing and pleasing the clients. Those who have Mercury retrograde will prove to be good critics and, with the aid of Jupiter's beneficial aspect, will be one of the leaders in journalism. If Mars also lends its assistance, they will have the fortune to own a press, as planet Mars stands for machinery, Mercury for paper and news, and Jupiter for publicity and propaganda. As it is an airy sign and Mercury indicates art and publicity, Mars and Gemini will produce radio-mechanics, assistants in the Defense Department, typists, compositors, or mechanics in aeronautics. Mercury stands for mathematics, and the greatest mathematicians are born in Gemini with very strong Mercury. Gemini, being the house of oscillation and the third house of the zodiac, suggests that the natives will love travel and movement from one place to the other and also a liking for changes in their profession. They will not have the inclination or pleasure to enjoy the sceneries but an inexplicable urge to be on the move. So they will be very good camp-clerks, traveling agents, traveling ticket-examiners, engine-drivers in the railway, and guards. The difference between the driver and the guard is that for the driver, Mars will be strong and aspecting the house for profession (10th house) or the lord of the 10th house or in any manner connected with lord of 2 (finance), or lord of 6 (service), or lord of 10 (profession). But for the post of the guard, Jupiter will be aspecting the planet in Gemini as Jupiter is the protector. Generally, Geminians are Jack of all trades. Being a dual sign, they will try to enhance their income by doing some side-business. They will be always on the lookout for new methods of earning which will bring them more money than what they get in any substantive post. A teacher may have tuition, a permanent servant in an office may take up any agency and increase his income, a typist in an office will take job works beyond office hours, or the clever Geminian may attend to other work during office hours, take up his regular work late in the evening, and claim overtime. Saturn's evil aspect and also Mars' malefic aspect will tempt one and offer him courage to misappropriate. Hence, they should never be allowed to handle cash. They should not accept the post of a booking clerk, cashier, or bill collector. As Gemini people will be receiving vast influence, good backing, and support, they can take up any post, stick to it without vacillation and worry, and slowly and surely rise in affluence and worry. They are advised, however, to be economical and not stingy and to meet all expenses with cheer. Money will not pour in for them, but their earnings are normally, in most of the cases, regular.

Domestic Environments

Gemini people will always be busy due to the frequent visits of business partners, customers, relatives, and friends. They delight in entertaining them. Though they may appear to be a little extravagant, they will manage their family well. They have a great liking for decorating their home and keeping it in modern style. They will not tolerate the nuisance of the owner of the house in which they are put up if the owner happens to be mean-minded and they will not mind changing their residence even frequently until they get a satisfactory one. As Gemini people cannot keep idle without ever thinking of how to improve the house, they will be doing something or other to give comforts to all the members in the family. They are ever fair.

Romance, Marriage, and Married Life

Geminians are capable of making friendships very quickly. So also they will find fault with them equally quickly. That is why they often fail to find a friend to their satisfaction even though they long for it. They do not wish to get themselves tied to one, but prefer variety in life, for Gemini is a dual sign, and the natives will feel that variety is the spice of life. The more the romances, the happier they will be.   
Such people cannot be understood easily. They will baffle many of their associates as they break off association with them if it does not interest them. Their affection is controlled by the mind more than by the emotions. They look on love from the intellectual angle and are often calculating or cynical.  
Marriage is full of interest and exciting for them. They are lucky if they get partners who are steady and accommodating. Marriage will be successful and delightful if the partner is equally intelligent. Both enjoy life by frequent short trips. The partner should be clever enough to appreciate the native's alert and intuitive mind. Gemini males need such wives who will always say 'Yes' whenever husbands wish to have a change of surroundings and environments. The partners should not take their flirtations seriously. The natives are so clever that they will end any romance if they feel that it is a source of expense and loss. These people will leave their homes if they find that they are having overbearing wives. They are unable to put up with constant pressure from the partners. Gemini brides are generally intelligent. Their strongest appeal is mental companionship, and they do not wish to be mere housekeepers. They will not give up their outside activities even though they get married, especially if they are already in service or well equipped for any service. They do not feel happy if their husbands were to resent. These girls have to be more tactful if they wish for happy, harmonious lives. As time passes on, they themselves will realize that they can have either of the two and will not mind giving up one and sticking to the other. For instance, if they want to serve and be a career woman, they will neglect the husband. But if they desire to lead a respectable home-life, they will give up their jobs and take to domestic life with utmost sincerity and devotion. They will be highly refined and will keep their homes tidy and arrange everything in apple-pie-order.  
Gemini people will have good understanding with partners born in the other airy signs Libra and Aquarius; because these two airy signs will form trine aspect with Gemini. The other two signs favorable are sextile to Gemini, i.e., Aries and Leo. Hence partners born in Thulam, Kumbum, Mesha, and Simha will match satisfactorily, their artistic tastes and mental attributes being similar. Natives born in Libra and Aquarius will have such an outlook on things which will please the husband or wife. Leonians (those born in Simha) should give up possessiveness and egotism. Arians lack the cultural standard otherwise they are happy. Geminians will have to give up the curious trait which will hurt the partner; that is, their tendency to make use of the same words and expressions of love to two and even more attachments. When one comes to know of this, the domestic life comes to an end in fireworks.  

Children

The Geminians are fond of their children because they are loved by them. They cannot be very paternal or maternal in their attitude towards their children. They may even feel that their children are a nuisance. So their bark will be worse than their bite. Their children need careful handling by the parents who have to understand them properly. Their minds will be very plastic and yielding and hence they can be molded in the right direction by the parents. They will have much of intuition. If the parents are not true or try to force anything on their children, the latter will not take it all right.

Handwriting

Gemini-borns will write a little above the line. The upper part of the letters will be well developed. The lines will be short, sharp, and inclined upwards. Their writing will be thin and loopless. They will not underline their signature and try to finish their letters quickly or if they underline, they will draw two lines one below the other.

Lucky day

Wednesday is ruled by Mercury who owns Gemini. Thursdays will prove to be lucky ones. Saturdays indicate much of difficulties, obstacles, and loss. Sundays offer short journeys and only on those days they clear off the arrears in their correspondence. Mondays will show an increase in their income. Fridays denote pleasurable pursuits and pleasant functions or expenses. On Tuesdays there may be a difference of opinion and even disputes, but on Tuesdays only, there will be victory over enemies. The most lucky day will be Thursday, and next to it only will be Wednesday.

Green and Yellow. Avoid Blue and Red.

Lucky number

Character to be corrected

Lack of concentration gives only a shallow understanding. They are occasionally heartless and behave like a cynic. Don't waver. Don't examine your own thoughts too much as you will become self-centered and discontented. Don't place yourself under any strain as it may lead one to be deceitful and dishonest. Don't try to do many things at the same time. Do one at a time. Do not pay heed to gossip as you will be easily influenced.

### Cancer: The Fourth Sign of the Zodiac
Cancer is the fourth sign of the Zodiac, located 30° from the 90th degree from the Vernal Equinox (or Aries Mesha 0 degrees) to the 120th degree. Punarvasu (Punarpushyam) 4th quarter (pada), Pushya (Poosam) and Aslesha (Ayilyam) are contained in the sign Cancer. Cancer is the first sign of the watery triplicity, the other two being Vrischika and Meena. Its quality is cardinal, movable, or chars. It is a feminine and fruitful sign, and is also a mute sign. If, for instance, a malefic like Ketu is posited in Cancer in the second house, it indicates a defect in speech; the native may be even dumb. Cancer is one of the five Prishtodaya rasis (Mesha, Rishaba, Dhanus, and Makara are the other four signs rising with their back). Cancer is a nocturnal sign (Gemini) and all Prishtodaya signs are termed nocturnal signs. It is a tropical sign, and a sign of long ascension. When the Sun is in Cancer, it will be in the northern hemisphere, and so Cancer is also termed a northern sign.  
This sign is symbolized by a crab. This does not mean that the crabs are fishy, nor that people born in Cancer are. Rather, the type of people born between these dates are called the Teacher or the Prophet, because they can teach or preach or recite or act or speak in public and carry the gathering with them. Cancer is governed by the Moon, and Jupiter is exalted here, its highest point of exaltation being 5 degrees. Mars is debilitated in this sign and is said to be completely debilitated (Paramaneecha) in the 28th degree. To the Sun, Cancer is a friend's sign; to Mercury, Venus, and Saturn, it is an enemy's quarter.  

Physical Features

Clumsy body, slender limbs, and powerful claws are the peculiarities of the crab. People born in Cancer generally have a large upper body. As age advances, they acquire, by over-eating, a prominent abdomen. Their face is wide between the ears, and the mouth is large with nice teeth of chalky colour. The hair is usually brown and the complexion pale. As the limbs are extremely slender when compared to the large upper body, the whole body appears top heavy and one will walk with a rolling gait. Generally, dwarfs are born in this sign.

Characteristics

The ruling planet of Cancer is the Luna or the Moon, Juliet says, "Oh, swear not by the Moon, the inconstant Moon, the inconstant Moon!". But Professor Masefield says, "The Moon, the inconstant, keeps her will". Cancer-born natives are remarkable for a changeful life. They have many ups and downs. Moon gives them fertile imagination, delighting in strange scenes and adventures. They can adapt to other's nature and quickly absorb other's ideas. They are often emotional and over-sensitive and also sympathetic. They are somewhat sentimental and talkative. Due to extreme sensitiveness, there will be a high degree of nervous irritability. They ably move the public to gain some position of wealth or honours. Just as one can see the Moon either waxing or waning, either as Full Moon or as New Moon, so also one can find the Cancer-borns timid on some occasions and very courageous under other circumstances.   
Generally, they are timid to face physical danger, but are brave in mental or moral attitude. Their temper is also changeable. Anger comes and goes in quick alternation.  
Cancer, being the fourth sign of the zodiac and the fourth house, indicates one's domestic environments. Cancer-borns are fond of home, family, and its comforts. They have tenacious memory, especially for family or historic events. Fear of ridicule or criticism makes them discreet, diplomatic, and conventional. They appreciate approbation and are easily encouraged by kindness. The ladies, born in this sign, are discreet and independent in many things.   
They are very laborious, though somewhat exacting.   
Their anger is short-lived and they hold no spite against anybody. As the fourth house shows estates, evil planets herein show that there will be difficulty in acquiring wealth. It is also likely that inheritance is lost through relatives or through children or speculation or by love attachments and pleasurable pursuits. Such experience will be only in the first part of the life of the Cancer-borns. In the latter part of their life, they will have grand success and prosperity. Generally, all Cancer-borns inherit money, property, kingdom, etc., but it comes to them only with great tardiness, or in spite of various hindrances, impediments, and obstacles. In advanced years, their children are often the source of protection.  
Cancer is said to be the sign of sensitive people and mediums. The higher vibrations of Cancer give the endowment of clairvoyance and a keen feeling for art. So the Cancer-borns have the psychic and mediumistic faculty. Many magicians, mimics, and actors are born in Cancer.  
Most of the Cancer-borns are sensitive, retiring, and unassuming. If they are ignored, overlooked, or neglected, they become moody and also peevish. Like the elephant, they will never forget.  
One will be lucky to have a partner born in Cancer who will be romantic and imaginative. The Cancer-borns recapture the golden moments of the past and keep the partner cheerful and enthusiastic.  
Cancer being a watery sign, the native can be easily influenced and will adjust to circumstances as water takes the shapes of the vessel in which it is kept.  
Water is not compressible. So also Cancer-borns, when coerced become very stubborn and determined; they will not yield.  
Cancer, being a movable and a watery sign, as water runs in a river, many Cancer-borns lead a wandering and restless life, thrown this way and that way, by emotions and imagination, by which they are completely ruled. They have rarely the necessary showmanship and push to come to the fore. Anyhow, it is from the states and position of the Moon at birth that the opportunities and chances can be reliably assessed.  
In love affairs, once their love is given or their affections centered they are strong and true. They will never give up unless the partner does something very drastic. Generally, they pour out boundless affection. That is why the relatives and friends enjoy real happiness in being underneath the Cancerian's roof.  
The Cancer-borns are famous for true hospitality.  
They tend to miss many an opportunity, being in the habit of pondering over a thing over and over again and put off the requisite action promptly at the proper time. When they are ready to move, they will find that the chance has slipped away. They will be undecided as to whether to purchase a lottery ticket, or not, and pass on any weeks in this way and when, finally; they decide to buy, they will find that the lottery had already been drawn. One will delay buying an umbrella or a raincoat but when he buys one, the rainy season would have come to an end. This should not be cultivated.  
Cancer-born natives have the deep feelings of loyalty and responsibility, if they decide upon a plan, they stick to it with dogged determination; success in their efforts is enjoyed ultimately. They are much more interested in getting small sums of money from a variety of sources than a big and sizable amount from one source. Anyone, getting a considerable lump amount in any single business, is not likely to be born in Cancer.  
Cancer-born natives realize the fullest significance of money and they are a little too personal.  
He may conquer the trials in his life, yet he does not forget them easily. They are ever brought to memory. A father who, from a humble beginning, rose up to a high position later, will, even though he is affluent, will constantly keep before his children the poverty in which he once lived.  
Cancer-born natives are ultimately fortunate.   
They will appear open and frank at sight, but, in reality, they are not so, as they hide much from others. They are impressionable and magnetic.  

Characteristics to be corrected

He has to be patient. People born in Cancer, with Saturn rising in the Ascendant, alone will be patient. Mars rising in Cancer makes one short-tempered also. Hence, patience and endurance are to be cultivated. Don't be very sensitive and extremely selfish. Changeability and indolence are the other weaknesses.

Health

Being the fourth sign of the Zodiac and one ruled by Moon, the health of the Cancer-borns will be fragile in youth, but as age advances, they will pick up health. Cancer rules the chest and stomach. As Moon owns this sign and it indicates one's worry etc., the chief cause of their physical troubles will be only worry.   
They have to take care of both the pulmonary and digestive systems. If they control their mind, they can control their body with the help of a reasonable diet, proper physical care, etc. They suffer much but they can also endure much. They should not let their love of liquids lead to over-indulgence in the alcoholic kind.   
They have to guard against asthma, gastric disturbances, and weak digestion. They should take care of the throat. Simple living is the best preventive.  
They should satisfy thirst with water and not with alcohol. A few suffer from rheumatism and sciatica.  
There are also indications of danger by falls and hurts from animals while traveling or residing in foreign countries. 

Disease

Affections of both the lungs, flu, cough, asthma, bronchitis, pleurisy, tuberculosis, affections of the oesophagus, stomach, dyspepsia, flatulence, dropsy, ben-ben, nervous debility, fear complex, hysteria, jaundice, obstruction of the bile, gall stones, worms, and boils on the chest just below the collar bone.

Finance and Profession

People born under the sign of Cancer are best suited to a commercial career, especially to the trade of a caterer. Many manage their own restaurants, coffee and tea stalls. Some run general stores, grocers, fruit stalls, etc. Those who enter into service are employed in hospitals as male and female nurses, matrons, managers, and secretaries in business, hire purchase regulators, undertakers, furnishers, etc. As Cancer-borns are historians and are interested in things of the past, they deal in antiquities; they collect curios. They get employed in the history section or archaeological department, or at least they will deal in second-hand articles.  
Cancer being a watery sign, Cancer-borns are dealers in things derived from water: couches, pearls, fish, etc. They also work as great sailors, sea captains, explorers, and in the navy and submarine. Some may serve in the shipping department, and take active interest in imports and exports, transport or travel, and in concerns dealing in milk products.  
As Jupiter is exalted in this sign, many born in this sign become successful preachers, inspiring teachers, eloquent orators, platform speakers, state ministers, and popular advisers. Mars, being debilitated here, indicates the krisans, agriculturists, and those working in gardens. Saturn in detriment shows that some will live by digging wells, excavating tanks, or diving in the sea.  
Cancer being the fourth sign of the Zodiac, the natives will be interested in developing Vedic and sacred texts. Cancer-borns are careful where money is concerned. Being themselves very honest, they cannot tolerate dishonesty in others. Their tastes are modest and hence they do not defray expenses on extravagant display. They value money for what it is worth and are very prudent. They accumulate wealth by dint of their own hard efforts.  

Domestic Environments

Cancer-born natives are devoted to their family and love their home wherever they live. The home and garden always keep them engaged, and they derive pleasure from being alone. They collect old things and store them in shelves and kitchen. Though they make constant journeys, they are only truly at home when they are in their own home. They do not mind taking trouble to make their life comfortable and will invite friends and attend to them to their fullest satisfaction.  

Friends and Benefactors

As Cancer-born natives are hypersensitive and unassuming, they have a great desire to acquire friendship but they do not have many long-standing and intimate friends. The Cancer-borns become moody and peevish whenever they feel that some friends neglect them or overlook them. But they will never forget the good done to them by friends and remain grateful to the core. They will recollect the old days and ponder over the benefits bestowed by friends.  

Romance

For Cancer-born natives, life is monotonous without romance. They will sacrifice their comforts, etc., and be very loyal and affectionate. But they cannot impress upon the mind of the partner that they are sincere, honest, and very true. The other is prone to feel that the Cancer-borns are fickle-minded and changeable, while, in fact, they are remarkably stubborn and determined.    

Marriage

Cancer-born natives enjoy their family life to the full and the home and family are of great consequence to them. Marriage, therefore, offers them an opportunity to have a well-settled life. Husbands born in Cancer are mostly affectionate, adjusting, and accommodating, even though, at times, they may be exacting and fussy. A Cancer-born native will generally contract marriage with a girl who will pave the way for domestic comfort and further prosperity. They will manage to keep the wife cheerful and buoyant, pleasing her in all ways. They are devoted to their wives, and occasionally, they will interfere in household routine and thereby spoil their good intentions. Their trait is, and this requires correction, that they are often dissatisfied and will be indulging in criticism of something or other.  
Girls born in Cancer are genuine in their love and sincere in their devotion to husbands. Occasionally they tend to be moody. They feel satisfied with anything offered by their husbands and prove good mothers to their children. They are adaptable and affectionate, dutiful and devoted, patient and pleasing, and sincere and sympathetic. They will spare no pains to attend to the needs of their husbands and offer them spiritual strength.  

Children

Cancer-born natives take efforts to give good education to their children and they are excellent parents in the matter of providing all facilities and comforts to them. They will go to the limit of sacrificing even their own needs, if necessary, to avoid denial of their children's desires. They are never disheartened by the large size of their family. Their children also remain grateful, obedient, dutiful, and faithful; they have great energy, courage, and independence. They are very frank; they stand up for their rights and never submit to imposition. They are full of worries, brooding over things that may happen, but they will never flinch in the hour of danger. They will perform deeds of heroism with a disregard of self which may amount to foolhardiness. Their mind will be cool, calm, collected, and sharp.

Handwriting

Moon, the lord of the sign, being variable in nature, the handwriting also will be variable; the formation of letters will be in different ways and shapes. Their letters will become large as they go on writing. When they are in a good mood, they draw wavy lines beneath their signatures.

Lucky Day

Tuesday is the day of success. Fridays give pleasure and profit. Wednesday is good for journey, investment, and expenses. Thursdays are good for contacting and arranging overdraft accounts. To join a college for higher studies, or to go overseas or to contact foreigners, Thursdays will prove auspicious. Avoid Saturdays as disharmony, difference of opinion, depression, dispute, delay, and denial will be the result generally. Mondays will give changeable temperament and success in efforts. Sundays are pleasant to have the company of close relatives and also to gain money. Also one should be lucky on the days when Moon transits in Mrigasirisha, Chitra, and Dhanishta (Avittam) star days. Poosam (Pushyam), Aslesha (Ayilyam), Anuradha (Anusham), Jyeshta (Kettai), Uthrabhadrapada (Uttirattathi), and Revati star days are to be avoided.

Lucky Colour

White, cream, red, and yellow are lucky colours. Blue and green colours should be avoided.

Luck Number

2, 7, and 9 are fortunate. 1, 3, 4, and 6 are good. 5 and 8 are to be avoided.

Lucky Gems

Diamond, pearls, ruby, and yellow sapphire. Avoid blue sapphire and emerald. Blue colour shows opposition and emerald will not allow one to save.

Characteristics to be Corrected

They have to overcome their timidity by their efforts with practical results. They should avoid inferiority complex. They should try to have something stable upon which they can pin their hopes. They should not be overanxious about the future. They should not be passive and lazy and should not pay attention to sentimentalities and vanity. They should not control emotions and develop the spiritual side. They should not be vindictive. And success will be in store for them.

### Leo or Simha
Leo is the central sign of the fiery triplicity, with Aries being the first fiery sign and Sagittarius being the third and last one. It is a hot, dry, masculine, positive, bestial, and barren sign, and is also a fixed sign and of ascension. Leo is ruled by the Sun, and only the Sun and Moon, the two luminaries, govern one sign each, Leo and Cancer respectively. Other planets, excluding Uranus and Neptune, own two houses each. In astrology, the luminaries, Sun and Moon, are considered to be "planets". Moon, Mars, and Jupiter are said to be in friend's quarters when they are in Leo, while Saturn, Venus, and Mercury are considered to be in enemy's camp if they transit in Leo. Uranus gets weakened in Leo, while Neptune gains strength. No planet gets exalted or debilitated in Leo.

Physical Features

People born in Leo will typically have well-developed bones, broad shoulders, and a tall, well-built, and muscular physique. They will never be plump or ugly, and will have a majestic, imposing, commanding, and dignified stature. The complexion of a Leo will vary depending on the exact position of the ascendant and the planets occupying or aspecting the ascendant.  
The personality of a person born in Leo will be as mentioned above if the ruler of the sign, the Sun, occupies it. However, this external expression can be modified due to the influence of the planets in the ascendant, the occupation of any sign by the ruler of the ascendant, and the various aspects from the other planets both the cusp of the ascendant and its lord. This means that even among twins born on the same day and in the same Lagna, there will be some differences due to this modification; otherwise, there would only be twelve patterns and it would be difficult to identify each individual.  

Characteristics

Sun owns Leo-Sim ha, Masefield says "The Sun still scatters out his store, It is true and the people born in this sign are noble, large-hearted, magnanimous and generous. Sun is necessary for the life and the growth of both the vegetables and animal kingdom. But, whenever Sun becomes furious, it destroys them. Darkness envelopes in the absence of Sun; when once Sun rises, none knows where the darkness has gone.   
Therefore the people born in this sign are helpful to mankind and other creations of God. Sun removes their darkness, ignorance and evil thoughts. It is said that Sun represents the Government. Those who have good aspect of Jupiter to Sun, invariably are assisted by, protected by and saved by the Government. Saturn forming evil aspect to Sun shows that such persons will be hated by, chased by and punished by the Government. So, either to lead a healthy and happy life or to face difficulties and lead a miserable life depends on the aspect to Sun and to the Cusp of the ascendant Leo. Accordingly, the characteristic of the person will get modified.  
Sun is the King of all the planets. It is masculine.  
So, the Leonians have dignity. They will have great faith in all friends and relatives and confide everything with them. They are capable of inspiring affection and admiration and have their purpose served by the willing co-operation of their colleagues and subordinates.  
Generally Leonians become the head of a show, registrar, ruler, chairman, host, hostess, managing director, administrator and chief of any organization and continue for a long period. At the same time these persons never hesitate to issue an order or ordinance to protect the interest of the mass. They do not talk much—the main characteristic is the habit of silence.   
They leave all the talking to others. They will hear very patiently all the complaints even from the menials and also pay heed to every rumor. But the judgment will be wise. They have the large-minded tolerance. They are endlessly energetic in serving their people. They will always forgive and forget the mistakes, sins, errors and deficiencies of others. They desire to be honored. But there is no false prestige in them. They mingle with people holding high offices and also menials. Since they trust everybody, it is not likely that they are cheated and disappointed as they do not discriminate. They live in a world of their own creation and nothing appears to be great for their ideality.  
Sun is worshipped during its transit from one sign to the other, especially during the time when it passes the Vernal equinox, as Vishu, or New Year's Day etc., when it enters Cancer as Dakshinayana; when it enters Libra in Thula month and when it passes on Capricorn as Makara Sankranthi. Just as Sun needs the feasts and sacrifices celebrated in its honor, so also the people born Leo are pleased by the praise of others.    
Anything can be had through a Leonian, if one honors him and speaks high of him in his presence.  
Generally, Mercurians are the favorites of the Leonians as they will not mind adopting those measures which will please them, and also mention that the Leonians have organizing powers and they are constructive, inventive, magnanimous and ingenious. They will take advantage of Leonians who are susceptible to flattery which may tend to become an exaggerated ego. Therefore don't fall a victim to flattery but correct yourself by remembering the old adage that, "He who has the greatest authority seldom shows it".  
As Leo is a fiery and fixed sign, it denotes authority and ambition, brilliance and boasting, clever action and commanding, dignity and domineering energy and enthusiasm, faith and fame, glory and grace, hopes and honour, intellect and inspiration, joy and jubilation, kindness and kingliness, loyalty and leadership, magnanimity and majesty, pomp and pride, respect and royalty, stately and scrupulous, vitality and vigour, and warmth and zeal.  
Leo being the fifth sign of the Zodiac, there will be an inordinate zeal and enthusiasm for sports and speculation. One will be interested in the pleasurable pursuits. In him, the higher emotions are the main centre of activity. He may take interest in music, opera, games, etc.  
Leo being a fixed sign, the person may be obstinate or indifferent as there will be the firmness and fixity of purpose. He is at his best only when there are handicaps and obstacles. He has considerable will power to win his way to his entire satisfaction. Having full faith and hope, he can accomplish and achieve his aims by persistent determination.  
Leonians are frank, open and just. Their outbursts do not last long, just like the extreme heat of the Sun. Leonians are noble and lofty in character. They scorn the mean, sordid and puny actions. They will never stoop to do a low act even when they get irritated or when there is the strong urge or self-interest. They do not hesitate to serve those whom they love even if they have to forego their comforts and everything for their loyal and true friends. They never do anything halfheartedly.  
As by nature they are authoritative and commanding, they want to be at the head of things, boss over others and be a leader. They dislike subordination. They will help everybody voluntarily. They will also donate or do charity whenever it appeals to them. But they resent those people who persistently ask for something. They do not, by nature, like those who make any demand upon the Leonians.  
Saturn forming good aspect with Sun or the ascendant Leo avoids giving way to fits of temper and over-exertion, so that there is no ill-effect on the heart. They will try and rise above any depression or sorrow they may have. It will protect one from committing mistakes and one will not be dictatorial and overbearing. They will guard against self-deception, false pride, hazardous speculations and any trouble. They will never rub on the wrong side or assert themselves at the wrong moment.  
If Mars afflicts Sun or the ascendant, the nature of the person will be changed. He will become bombastic, domineering and blustering. He cannot be trusted in any department of life. If he marries anybody, he will prove to be unfaithful, amorous, disloyal, mean and short-tempered. Good aspect of Mars gives courage and grand success. Aspect of Mars and Saturn to Sun is very important. Adverse aspects will offer bitterest experiences in life. Remember the brightest light will always cast the deepest shadow.  

Weakness to be Corrected

Generally, Leonians do not consider both sides of a question. It is advisable for them to take into account other's views, ideas, and suggestions. Whenever Leonians are crossed, they become extroverted and may act aggressively, particularly during the sub-period of the planet that afflicts the Sun. It is important to remember that charity should begin at home, but over-liberality, which can leave one in a state of want, is also not desirable. The Sun never retrogrades and always moves forward, and Leonians should strive to do the same, without considering the past or future. It is important to be patient and not be hasty or get irritated before those whom they have helped show their gratitude. Leonians should avoid forcing conclusions at their own risk and not be arrogant. They should strive to maintain an attractive home and a comfortable-sized bank position, and not spend away all they have and all they get. Big enterprises will move slowly, so Leonians should not be hasty and take others' advice. They should consider both sides of a question, proceed steadily, and guard against the subtle influence of flattery. Leonians should not try to dominate all the time, as others will also desire freedom. They should be careful in their dress, but not be a slave to ever-changing fashion.  

Health and Disease

Generally, these people should have a strong constitution. Even if they become ill, they tend to recover quickly from any illness. However, they are easily alarmed when sickness overtakes them. Leo indicates the heart, the spinal column, spinal marrow nerves and fibers. Leo influences the bones, dorsal vertebrae, and interspinal muscles. Anterior and posterior coronary, aorta, and vena cava are ruled by Leo. Therefore, heart disease, palpitations, spinal meningitis, syncope, locomotor ataxia, inflammations, sunstroke, giddiness, and pestilence are other disorders. Epilepsy and rheumatic fever are diseases from which one may suffer when the ascendant is afflicted by Mars and Saturn, respectively. As Aquarius opposes Leo and Capricorn is the sixth sign counted from Leo, malefics in Capricorn and Aquarius can cause swelling in the ankle followed by heart disease. Jupiter in Leo will protect one from any surgical aid, but if Mars afflicts it, it can lead to coronary thrombosis or the need for surgical aid. As Leo rules the heart, which is the vital part of the body, temperate living is absolutely necessary. One has to avoid drinks, beverages, and stimulants, but one should take a balanced diet. That is why our ancestors were very particular about having a "sathvic" diet.

Finance and Fortune

Leo is symbolized by the lion, which is the king of the animals. Therefore, one's natural instinct is to always seek the highest position and, usually, one has it rightfully. One will try to deal with large issues and leave the routine, monotonous drudgery and minor details to subordinates. One is by nature a spendthrift, even when poverty may threaten them. One will be able to face any hard time. Generally, fortune favors Leonians when they are young and they will have sufficient resources. However, because they spend lavishly, their bank position will deteriorate as age advances. Leo being the fifth sign of the zodiac, one will be tempted to gamble and speculate. Luckily, their risks will amply reward them. Speculators are very liberal when they give gifts to others and do not hesitate to lend financial assistance to the needy. One will please themselves with the sweet smile of those to whom they present costly ones and will feel proud when they think that others borrow from them and approach them for a favor.

Profession

Sun, the ruler of this sign Leo, will influence in directing one's choice of profession. It favors high positions in commerce or government. As Leo is a fixed sign, one may have a fixed income, security of service under the government, etc. It is the fifth sign of the zodiac, so one earns through speculation, music, theatre, opera; being a fiery sign, one may be a jeweler, goldsmith, or one working in precious metals. As this sign gives executive ability and tireless application to work, one will be fit to manage great enterprises. Presidents, managers of corporations, managing directors of concerns, officials, superintendents, directors, captains, and sales managers are born in Leo. Planets forming favorable aspects specify the nature. If Mars is favorable, it makes one a soldier, surgeon, chemist, dentist, barber, butcher, worker in iron, copper, and with instruments; Mars and Leo favor the defense department and warlike pursuits. Mercury produces sales managers, share-brokers, ambassadors, counselors, auditors, engineers, architects, etc. Jupiter forming favorable aspect with Leo produces lawyers, judges, priests, bankers, and physicians. Venus in Leo indicates those in the administrative department of transport, travels, food, agriculture, and those who deal in glass, cloth, silk, provisions, and luxurious articles. Saturn favors mines, coal, wood, estates, lead, and plumber or menial posts. Thus, depending on the aspect received, the nature of the profession is to be judged.

Domestic Environments

The health of the native needs relaxation. Absolute peace, harmony, and happiness will keep them cheerful. Just as a king expects his subjects to be submissive and always favors them, Leonians will try to be the leader in the house and expect all those at home to be cooperative, obedient, and grateful. They want the members of the family to have a broad outlook and to be magnanimous and noble. Leonians choose their good friends and entertain them often. They never hesitate to spend money to maintain prestige and honor. Even when sandalwood is pulverized and thrown into fire, it does not lose its fragrance. So also, these people will never think of economy, even when they are driven to a state of poverty. They will lead the same aristocratic life and their home will be an impressive one. They will spend much on dress, screen cloth, curtains, furniture, etc. They will keep the home tidy with all the attractive trimmings, decoration, etc.  
If the male is born in one sign but the wife is born in Leo, then it is a problem for him to please her by supplying her dress, jewels, etc. If he does not satisfy her, readers can guess his fate. His home will be his Hell in this life. But if he is able to meet her demands, then his home is his Heaven.  

Romance, Marriage, and Married Life

The person born in Leo is romantic. They love deeply and they will be carried away by love. They cheer up the partner most skillfully like an actor in a comedy scene. They are an ideal lover, as they will be fiery and passionate. But they will never like any demonstration of love in public, as they consider it below their dignity. They will have abundant charm and be attractive to the opposite sex. It is but natural that the partner is jealous as the Leonian will be always in the midst of a crowd of ladies. Therefore, the partner should have proper understanding. They should share their pleasure when they give plenty of parties to others and have exciting times with them. Unless they have Saturn, Mars, and Venus in the ascendant, 5 or 7 or 11, they need not mistake the Leonian husband. If one understands them and agrees with them, they will be liked, loved, and admired by the person born in Leo. They will fit in the domestic routine admirably. They will never allow anybody to disrespect their wife or any member of their family. They are very proud of their family. They will not tolerate any ill-repute. They are always conscious of their social standing and are chivalrous.  
As Leo is a fiery sign, partners born in the same or the other two fiery signs, Aries or Sagittarius, or in any of the three airy signs, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius, will suit well. If one links their fortune with another born in Leo itself, it is advisable that both understand each other, so that there can be no trouble in their married life. Aries and Sagittarius born will contribute to their happiness and harmony. In the airy signs, Aquarius, Libra, and Gemini, persons born in Aquarius will be devoted to Leo borns. Brides born in Libra will ever try for company, avoid troubles, and purchase peace at any price. Ones born in Gemini will be very tactful and will never do anything which the husband may hate. The Geminian will be an inseparable partner and they will be sincere and affectionate.  
The Leo lady is ambitious and ideal. They will manage their home admirably. At the same time, they are successful social workers. They can make a favorable impression on all. Their devotion both to their home and to the general public is supreme. They will be offered prominent positions. They are self-sacrificing ladies with everlasting love. They cannot expect any good return from those to whom they lend their assistance at the risk of their own interests. A Leo bride marrying an Aries husband is lucky, as they have a commanding person so that they will know their limits and will not overstep in exercising their authority or in spending lavishly. They need one to keep them under control, so that they can appreciate their husband's good nature, affection, kindness, and real love to lead a pleasant, prosperous, and peaceful life. For, they will have pretty fixed ideas, and they will feel that their word is law, and will expect others to do only those which they desire and consider right.  

Children 

People born in Leo love their children most and are very proud of them. Generally, their children will be restless and may even be nervous, striking out for independence at a young age and disliking restriction. Leo-born parents should let their children feel that they rely on them, otherwise they will lose their confidence. Children born in Leo will try to lead and boss over the other children, proving to be good leaders with great vitality, ambition, and persistence. They will be popular because they do not desire to have honour for themselves by appropriating what others have done, being good-natured, obliging, and affectionate. They have courage and confidence to crown them with success.  

Handwriting

As the lord of Leo is the Sun, which is round and full of curves, the handwriting of people born in Leo will be marked by regular circles and will consume much space, with flourishes added to the words. They will write in straight and regular lines, with upright and vertical letters.

Lucky Days

Sundays are good for taking medicine, tonic, etc. to recoup health, to undertake any enterprise, to meet high officials, and to purchase items governed by the Sun. Mondays should be avoided, as they can lead to waste of money, loss of prestige, secret inimical activities, and irritation. Tuesdays are good for grand success in competitive examinations, and for purchasing property, cars, etc. and going on long journeys. Wednesdays are good for approaching bankers for overdrafts, entering into contracts, taking up agencies, signing documents, and registering. Thursdays are good for lending money, purchasing costly items for wives, and purchasing land and cars for children. Fridays are auspicious for short journeys, transfers, and promotions. Saturdays should be avoided, as they can lead to deception and fraud.

### Virgo - Kanni
Virgo is the sixth sign of the Zodiac, extending from the 150th degree from the Vernal Equinox (Aries - Mesha 0 degree) to the 180th degree. It is the second sign of the Zodiac ruled by Mercury, and the second earthy sign. It is a negative, feminine, barren, cold, dry, nocturnal, and northern sign, and it is of long ascension. Mercury is not only the ruler of this sign, but it is exalted here. Venus, though a good friend of Mercury, is debilitated in Virgo. Whenever the Sun, Moon, Mars, and Jupiter occupy this sign, they are said to be in an enemy's camp. Saturn alone is in a friend's quarters when it is in Virgo.  
Mercury's exaltation in this sign and Venus' debilitation here confirm that Mercurians prefer wisdom to wealth. Goddess Lakshmi and Goddess Saraswathi do not live together in one place. Both cannot co-exist. Spiritual wealth and knowledge, which Saraswathi bestows on us, is inexhaustible and no dacoit can rob it. The possessor never becomes a bankrupt; it is ever full and, if at all, it improves. This wisdom leads one to immortality, whereas material wealth may lead to immorality.  
Virgo is traditionally symbolised as Virgin-Mary. In the ancient Zodiac, it was symbolised as a Virgin, lying prostrate, in one of her hands she holds Spica - seed-wheat and in the other a stem of a tree. The capital of France still retains its name of Paris (Paras - Isis) under the protection of Isis-Virgo. Its great Cathedral bears the name Notre Dame (Our Lady).  
Leo French says, "Light dawns on chaos, whenever a son of Mercury is born. He should be cherished and forfended from any materialising or coarsening influence so far as possible, during childhood. The Virgo child shares this sensitiveness, though the expression thereof is somewhat different, the earthly element of Virgo giving the native reserve and diffidence, whereas the aerial essence of Gemini in its true, pristine birth nature is free from the curse of matter, self-consciousness. Gemini is timid and elusive, evasive in decadence. Virgo is shy and self-conscious.  
Even though Mercury may occupy its own sign, yet it is so different in Virgo from the other sign, Gemini, and so different is its effect on everything with which it comes in contact, that the casual astrological observer would not recognise the planet as the same Budha-Mercury.  

Physical Features

The native will be tall with a slender body, dark hair and eyes, curved eyebrows with much hair growth, a thin and even shrill voice, and they will walk quickly. They often appear younger than their actual age due to their activity, and they have a straight nose, indicating that they are very clever, not necessarily cunning. The forehead near the eyebrows will be pronounced, and the expression of their eyes will be honest and frank. Among Westerners, most of the Virgo-borns will have beautiful blue eyes (Venus is the ruler of the second sign).

Characteristics

Virgo is ruled by inconstant Mercury, so change is always desired. Most of you are forever changing your residence or jobs. Of all the people born in the 12 signs of the Zodiac, you Virgoans are very conscientious and capable of handling even unfavourable conditions. You will mark time and get prepared to handle it wisely. You have a commercial instinct that is ingrained. You will be very brisk and quick in your work, just like the fast-moving Planet Mercury. You will expect others to be brief in their statements and representation, and to be businesslike. But when you begin to talk or explain, you pay attention to the details of things, adding such wealth of detail that it can make others feel bored and vexed. You rarely come to the point quickly. If you are a drawing master, you will include all conceivable details.  
You are thorough and methodical. Your first thought and action will be sensible and rational. You are practical and discriminative. You may be careful but you are severely critical. Self-pity is one of your vices. You will be at your best if you are an inspector, auditor, income-tax officer, or examiner, as you are very good and quick at finding fault with others. If you have a weak Mercury in your horoscope, you are prone to dissatisfaction and if the task is difficult, you will give it up in despair. But if your Mercury is strong, you will go ahead and try to do perfectly whatever you undertake. You will be a genius, able to analyse, dissect, and go deep into the matter.  
Being an earthy sign, you will have the desire to save money. You will be prudent and always keep a small sum of money that none is aware of. If you travel, you will keep a part of your cash in one pocket, something in the other, and safely some more amount, with the idea of not spending it, in your suitcase. You will be so over-careful that you will not mind reopening the cover written by you just before posting it. You will verify once, twice, and thrice before you finish a work, thus avoiding mistakes.  
If you have to consult a doctor, you will sit down for hours, write a big history-sheet about your constitution to the last detail, try to recollect your old complaints, and present a big file to the doctor, even though your complaint is actually very simple. You are remarkable for keeping everything in its place properly and orderly. You will maintain accounts and the day-book with all details. You will keep personal files and all documents in perfect condition.  
Unfortunately your subordinates or servants at home will not be born in Virgo and will not be equally brisk and brilliant. So to the extent to which you expect them, they can never keep up and satisfy you. Virgo, being a feminine and earthy sign, you will take delight in horticulture, agriculture, gardening, etc. It is said that Virgo, Gares (Demeter) is the goddess of agriculture and of legislation and social order. You are governed much by intellect as Mercury gets exalted here. You will not be sympathetic, as Venus gets debilitated in this sign. Saturn, aspecting Virgo, will make you lazy and fond of taking things easy. But you derive pleasure in driving others and be very masterful with subordinates.
Being a common sign, there will be changes in your environments, and you will form associations and friendships.  
Mercury shows that you will be fond of studying science, and particularly about medicine, food, diet, hygiene, etc., being the sixth sign of the Zodiac. Mercury as lord of the 6th sign, called the Hospital of Zodiac, indicates that if ever you fall ill, you lack the will-power and will often brood over the disease, imagine too much, never cheer yourself up, to get you out of the clutches of your illness. Thus, you will be ruining your health. Further, you will always look for sympathy. But at the same time, when you are healthy, if anybody falls ill, you will prove to be a very good nurse.  
Neptune in Virgo gives a scheming mind. One may be a deceptive individual and be interested in illicit pleasure. Neptune in the exact cusp produces thieves, cunning, and most diplomatic scoundrels. Uranus in Virgo Ascendant makes one clever, learned, and versatile. You may be employed as a teacher, a writer, a superintendent, or an excise officer. Uranus always offers a research mind. Virgo gives an analytical nature. Hence, many research scholars are born in Virgo having good aspects with Uranus. Great musicians, statisticians, journalists, and scientists are also born under such favourable positions.  

Characteristics to be Corrected

The native's nature is to be very chatty and analytical. In conversation, they will give lengthy descriptions, including all meticulous details which can be boring to others. They will be restless until they pass their remarks and criticize others' faults and idiosyncrasies. Even members of their family may not appreciate their comments and criticism. They should avoid too much analysis over even minor things and should not have nervousness and self-doubt. Though they may be intelligent and have quick perception, they will need steadiness in going after what they want. They should also avoid changeability and should not proceed to another work until the earlier one is completed. They should not ask for everyone's advice about a situation and get so confused and uncertain that nothing is accomplished. They should trust their own judgement and intelligence and not seek advice from others. If they do consult a doctor or an astrologer, they should pin their faith on one and take their advice. If they consult many, they will be confused. They should stick to a single person's advice which will be the best. They should develop true consistency of purpose, learn to forget others' mistakes, and forgive them for their faults. They should not have long sustained resentment.  

Health

You are normally a temperate person and live sensibly, so you enjoy robust health with long life and healthy old age. When you are young, you will be very active and appear much younger due to your activity. You are also very particular about your diet, so you do not fall ill often. However, planets afflicting your Ascendant can cause digestive and intestinal troubles. People with malefics in Virgo often suffer from dysentery, typhoid, and sprue during their periods. Malefics in Virgo suggest that you need plenty of rest and calm surroundings, and you must have lots of exercise, especially when your Ascendant is afflicted. Your weak points physically are your nervous system and your stomach, both of which are sensitive. Hence, if you include much of Vitamin B in your diet, you can avoid these troubles and have regular meals. You should also try to have a balanced diet. Illness may be very minor, but due to your imagination, you may exaggerate it and make yourself unhappy. As Virgo-borns have Saturn as lord of 6 and Mars as lord of 8, it is observed that they will have minor injuries very often, and it is likely that they meet with accidents. Therefore, do not be rash.  
As Virgo indicates abdomen and bowels, and as it is ruled by Mercury which has influence over the nervous system, disorders of the bowels can react on the mental condition. Further, disturbed mental status, business as well as domestic worries, can reflect adversely on the bowels. Hypochondria is indicated by this sign. The functions of Virgo are absorption, assimilation, selection and utilisation. Its action is chylifactive. A vegetarian diet, well-proportioned, is preferred. You should avoid worries, discontentment, irritability, and short temper. Normally, you will have few temptations for excess. High living and deep drinking should also be avoided. Be on guard against gall-stones. Avoid alcohol. But you will always remember "An apple a day, will keep the doctor away".    

Finance

As you possess a sound commercial instinct, you are normally careful about your money. You have the great desire to become rich and hence you are very conscious about the value of money. You do not usually come by fortune and much of wealth. You will work hard, and the remuneration will not be satisfactory, as the lord of 6 is Saturn. Investments also will not prove to be good, as the returns will be poor. You may have many ups and downs. It is only through your own talent and hard work that you will be able to come to the top.

Profession

People born in Virgo should make a correct choice of their financier or partner in business. He should select one with much enthusiasm and courage. He will use short-cut methods; you will worry about minor details and get discouraged now and then. But the partner should be one who always cheers you up and makes the best use of your intelligence. Generally you become a slave to your work; you are also a hard taskmaster. You will prefer to be left alone to carry out your work in a quiet place peacefully.  
Sun, forming good aspect with lord of 2 or 6 or 10 in Virgo, indicates that you may be a successful medical officer. You may work in the Medical or Public Health department. Also, you can get into Government service in Engineering, Auditing, Teaching, etc. Mars also forming good aspect, denotes that one can have their own nursing home or deal in scientific instruments, appliances, etc.  
Moon, forming good aspect with lord of 2 or 6 or 10 in Virgo, shows that one may be employed in the Engineering or Accounts department in Shipping, Port Trust or Navy, or in those concerns dealing in liquids, like petrol, mercury etc. Also, it is shown that one may be serving in the Textile department, inks, inkstands, pens may be manufactured.  
Mars, forming good aspects with lord of 2 or 6 or 10 suggests that you may interest yourself in the Press printing, editing, publishing, writing, or serve as a clerk in any industry or in the Defense department; be a surgeon or independent auditor or one working in the Military accounts, or be a mechanical engineer or a military engineer. It is also likely that you may serve in the expansion of plants for steel, fertiliser, agricultural implements, etc. If Mars is also afflicted, one will amass wealth by black-market or by committing theft or robbery.  
A warning to such people is necessary. A few of your servants may have venomous tongue, and by doing propaganda of false libels. Somehow, they will manage to have confidential information from their friends in their unguarded moments, and be going on exploiting the friends, who have to give money, simply to please such undesirable persons. Otherwise, you will get into trouble. Therefore, it is advisable to scrutinise the horoscope of at least the Private Secretary, so that you can avoid such troubles later, when Mars and Mercury conjointly operate. They will have the courage even to come to the court, and give witness against you. It is a pleasure for such persons to turn hostile and spoil you and similar higher officials, if Mars forms disharmonious aspect with Mercury.  
Mercury forming good aspect, shows that you will be a broker, book-keeper, accountant, teacher, lawyer, or pharmacist. You may be the author of many books. You may become a good journalist. You may be an interpreter, Registrar or letter carrier. You will have the desire to study all problems in minute details, and solve them in your own way, as you are good on devices and systems. As a lawyer, you will be successful in cross-examination.  
Jupiter, forming good aspect with the lords of 2, 6 or 10 in Virgo, indicates that you may have literary, scientific, or any other intellectual pursuit. You may be a publisher, editor, or a journalist. Religion, law, insurance, investment, or speculation, may also be your profession. You may work in Religious Endowment Board or temple or church, in law courts, banks, etc. It is likely that you will work in any embassy, or go out as an ambassador.  
Venus, forming good aspect, shows that you will be a good musician, actor, painter, or artist. You may be engaged in making toilet accessories, manufacturing women clothing, etc. You may deal in all articles needed for personal adornment. Confectioners, caterers, bakers, restaurant keepers and perfumery dealers are also born in Virgo, having favourable aspect from Venus, or when it occupied Virgo at the time of birth, as Venus is lord of 2.  
Saturn (lord of 6), forming a beneficial aspect with Venus, lord of 2, and with Mercury, lord of 10, in Virgo, or when Saturn was in Virgo at the time of birth, one will have competence in mathematics, statistics, accounts, physics, dynamics, etc. You will serve in mines or engineering departments. You may engage in exporting mine ore. You may hold responsible posts and positions of trust. As you will be industrious and methodical, you will thrive in business. You are likely to serve in the Finger Print Office, if Mars also aspects, as Mars indicates Police and Crime.   
Uranus indicates that one may serve in the railway, electricity, election, or nutrition research departments. Jupiter, forming strong beneficial aspects, will offer the native the post of Finance Minister, and not Revenue Minister, as the latter is to collect money for the Government, whereas the former is to spend away, and also to borrow, whenever needed. Virgo being the sixth sign of the Zodiac, and as the 6th house shows debts and dispute, he will be the minister for election, or be serving in the Election department. A few may work in the Aviation department or Census office.   
Neptune, forming a good aspect with lord of 2, 6, or 10 in the Ascendant Virgo, indicates that you may serve in big industries, tea estates, export and import departments, or in shipping.  

Domestic Environments

Wanderlust is your nature. You will often change your residence to have a change in scenery and neighborhood, just like those born under the sign of Cancer. You want to keep everything in your home in order and expect your people to work methodically, putting on a show when guests are invited. You insist on keeping everything neat, saying, "A place for everything and everything in its place". You prefer to entertain others in your home, but you do not return their visits. As Jupiter is the lord of the fourth house, you will always be lucky in procuring houses to live in. Even when you invest in buildings, you will be able to purchase them in a good locality. The value of the property will increase during the period of Jupiter. However, Saturn being the lord of the 5th and 6th houses, and Mars the lord of the 8th house, they show that there may be losses in investments during the joint periods of Saturn and Mars. It is advisable for Virgoans to dispose of their holdings during their Jupiter periods, when the price will be higher, whether it is investment shares or land. Otherwise, a necessity will arise during the following Saturn's period, and it will be disposed of at a loss, and you will be depressed.  
Jupiter is not only lord of 4th but also the lord of the 7th house. Hence, your partner in life will be God-fearing, religious, law-abiding, and true. Therefore, you will have a peaceful and pleasant domestic life.  

Friends and benefactors

You have your own peculiarities. You prefer only intelligent people who have a good future, and you will offer your assistance only to them. The defect in you is that you expect them to say "Thanks" before you actually render your help, and also gain a "Thanks" after you have done it. You expect them to mention in many words that they want and appreciate your friendship. Normally, you do not mix with all people; you make your choice. You feel delicate to approach strangers for any help you need. You want friends and you cannot do anything for them with pleasure, unless they recognize, approve, and appreciate. You need friends more for this purpose. Just as you have the desire to change residence, etc., so also you will form friendships with new persons. The 11th house indicates benefactors. The 11th house is ruled by the Moon, which is also inconstant. People born on Mondays, Rohini, Hastham, and Sravanam star days, or in Cancer, will be good friends indeed.

Romance and Marriage

You have your own ideals. To find one suiting to your taste is difficult. Therefore, there will be a long delay in choosing one to measure up to your ideal, as everything must be perfect, as far as you are concerned. It is likely that, in the first few cases, you will be disappointed. Whenever you desire to make a selection, you attach more value to intelligence than to the pleasure in romance. Further, you are often shy, and do not demonstrate your affection. You should not be so touchy. For a happy life with your wife, to some extent, you should give expression to your affection. You should remember that love demands good understanding, and it cannot stand any criticism. Your temperament is to find fault with others. That you must give up. Just as you expect others to appreciate your assistance or intelligence, so also, whether the person whom you love is equally intelligent or not, you have to simply admire her beauty (even though she is not very fair) and her company and give expression to it. Virgoans are rarely passionate. By conversation, at least, they should keep the partner cheerful, and also get such books for her to read.  
A male born in Virgo will lead the married life more on a partnership basis, although it is a business or as a part of the social scheme. That is why many people born in Virgo postpone their time of marriage and prefer to be a bachelor for a long time. Your desire is more to be studious and to be doing research work in a peaceful atmosphere. But, when once you get married, you make all provision for your wife and the other members of your family. It is likely that you may be often complaining about your health which you should avoid. As Mercury rules this sign, you have a nervous active manner. You will consider the nervous tensions as actual symptoms of some illness, and you not only worry within yourself, but cause more worry to your partner and others.  
Luckily, the partner's ruling planet will be Venus, lord of 2, or Jupiter, lord of the 7th house, or Moon, lord of the 11th house. As all three are benefics by nature, and give fertile imagination to the partner, she will be able to understand you properly and conduct herself wisely, giving always encouragement to you whenever you need it. It is the good nature of your wife, i.e., adjustability, accommodation, and good understanding that will be responsible for your happy life with such a dutiful wife.  
Virgo-borns will be peevish and occasionally mean; they are so thrifty that their husbands will become economical within a few years after marriage. Her idea of marriage is a legal partnership, and that she should live in a business-like way. She will run the home in a very regulated routine manner, without herself wasting anything nor allowing others to waste or be extravagant. She will attend to her duties quickly and most satisfactorily. But, she will not be able to please her husband in spiritual life or in keeping pleasant company. She will cling to the idea that sex is mean, base, and one day or other troublesome. A clever partner has to change her frame of mind, and should not mistake her.  

Children

People born in Virgo will have a limited number of children, as the 5th house is ruled by Saturn. They may also have to spend much on their studies, necessitating Virgoans to borrow, as the lord of the 5th house is also the lord of the 6th. It is also indicated that Virgo people may borrow and invest in landed properties, which will be later enjoyed by their children. Even though they may not show their affection to them, Virgoans will never fail in their duty to train them, give them proper education, and make them fit enough to hold any post admirably in their official career. Among their children, the eldest will be plodding, persevering, and patiently working and prospering, while the second and third children will maintain good health and enjoy fortune with less effort.

Handwriting

Virgoans are governed by strong Mercury, so they may write in between two lines, i.e., above the line. They will develop the upper part of the letters. The lines written by them will be short, sharp, and also include upwards. They always use sharp pointed nibs, and hence, their writing will be thin. They do not waste ink by putting loops, etc. and avoid underlining their signature, more to save time. If at all they underline, Mercury, lord of the sign, shows that they will do it twice.

Lucky Day

Virgoans' ruling planet is Mercury, who owns both the Ascendant and the most powerful, effective, and successful house, the 10th, i.e., the meridian. Therefore, Wednesday, governed by Mercury, will be the most lucky day for them. Even though Venus gets debilitated in this sign, as she rules the second and ninth houses, Bagya Sthana, Fridays will bring fortune. Mars, ruling the third and eighth houses, indicates that Tuesdays are inauspicious, especially for speculation, betting, short travels, or correspondence, and for signing any important document. Saturdays are not beneficial, as they threaten with delay, denial, and disappointment. Sundays will end in a loss. Mondays are good to meet friends, make new friendships, bet, speculate, and ever gain. Thursdays are favourable to invest, to buy cars, etc., also to commence romance, or start a family and life with a wife in new quarters. It is also very good to form partnerships in business and expand one's enterprise.

Lucky Colour

Green, white, and yellow. Avoid red and blue. When Virgoans put on red and blue only, their health fails, and they meet with minor injuries and face difficulties. The moment they give them up, there will be no more evil. Putting on white shows fortune, green ones and emerald show promotion in official life, and also prosperity in business. Yellow ones are good for happy domestic environments.

Lucky Numbers

5, 14, 23, 32, 41, etc. 2, 11, 20, 38, 47, etc. 7, 16, 25, 34, 43, etc. 6, 15, 24, 33, 42, etc. 3, 12, 21, 30, 48, etc.

Lucky Stone

Emerald, pearl, diamond, and yellow sapphire. Virgoans are generally fortunate in those years when Jupiter gets exalted in Cancer. It is certain that Jupiter, transiting in the constellation Aslesha, will offer the most beneficial results to them, as Aslesha is ruled by Mercury, the lord of the 1st and 10th houses, and it is in the 11th house which promises pleasure, profit, permanent ties of friendship, and fulfillment of one's cherished desires.

Objects Indicated by Virgo

Gardens, both wet and dry lands, corn fields, granaries, grain elevators, restaurants, pantries, places where fruits and vegetables are kept, the storeroom, also book shelves, first aid box, medical box, libraries, closets, dairies, etc.

Countries

Turkey, Croatia, Mesopotamia, Babylon, Assyria, the locality between Tibet and the Euphrates, Greece, Thessaly, Corinth, Monz, Switzerland, Lower Silesia, Brazil, Virginia, and West Indies.

Towns

Jerusalem, Navarre, Paris, Brazil, Padua, Lyons, Toulouse, Reading, Baghdad, Cheltenham, Norwich, Todmorden, Boston, Brindisi, Corinth, and Los Angeles.

### Libra - Thulam
Libra is the 7th sign of the Zodiac and is 30 degrees in longitude, extending from the 180th degree from the Vernal Equinox (Aries-Mesha 0') to 210'. The commencement of Libra, i.e., the 180th degree, is termed the Autumnal Equinox and is a crossing place or intersection of the ecliptic and celestial equator. The sun passes over from north to south declination and at the time when the Sun enters 0 of Libra, the night and the day are equal throughout the world. Hindus celebrate this and call it Thula Masam. The old Mexicans and Egyptians also celebrate this and have feasts on this day. Chitra, second half (third and fourth padas), Swathi, and Visaka one, two and three padas are contained in this sign, Thulam.  
Libra is the 7th sign of the Zodiac and is governed by Venus. It is the 2nd airy sign and is said to be the day house or Moola Trikona sign of Venus. The 1st sign of Venus, Taurus-Rishaba, is an earthy sign, whereas Libra is an airy sign. Taurus-Rishaba is a fixed sign, whereas Libra is a movable (chars) sign. Libra is a positive sign and not negative like Taurus. Alan Leo calls Libra the equalising sign of the Zodiac and it is signified as the sign of the balance.  
Saturn is exalted in Libra and the Sun is debilitated. Moon, Mars and Jupiter, when they occupy this sign, are said to be in the enemy's camp. Libra is symbolised by a man stationed in a public market, holding a balance in his hand and dealing in his commodities. It is called the sign of Vyapari, Vaisyas-Businessmen. It is the human biped sign of long ascension.  

Physical features

The person born with Libra as ascendant grows tall with a well-proportioned body. Their limbs will be slender but strong. Their appearance will be graceful with a sweet smile and their countenance attractive. The eyebrows add to their beauty. In the adult age, the occipital region gets bald. The nose will be a little bent like the parrot.

Characteristics

As Libra is symbolized with balance, Librans will be level-headed; they can maintain mental equilibrium, weigh the merits and demerits, and pass a dispassionate opinion. They are the best judges. While they debate, they excel others in comparing and contrasting. They are constructive critics. Venus, the ruler of this sign, makes the native courteous, modest, and gentle. He is always for a happy and harmonious life and will not rub on the wrong side. He will purchase peace at any cost and will be upright and sympathetic. Even when he loses his temper, he will soon be quietened. He tries to lead a pleasant life, enjoying all the fruits of life. He is fond of dress, perfumeries, art, and music. Venus shows that Librans will have hobbies and, being a movable sign, they will be changing from one to another. Photography, gardening, drawing, painting, embroidery, etc. may be their hobbies.  
As Libra is the sign opposite to Aries, the Librans will forego their personal comforts but work hard for the benefit of others. Politicians born in Libra will be popular throughout life, whereas Aries-borns will be in power during beneficial periods and be nowhere during adverse days. Libra is an airy sign, so it confers fertile imagination, correct intuition, brilliant intellect, admirable refinement, supreme indemnity, pleasant nature, etc. He will be a proper adviser to plan anything with correct forethought. As Saturn gets exalted here, one can concentrate, meditate, and reach a higher plane in spiritual life also. Sri Narasimha Bharathi, Sri Ramana Maharishi, the sages, and the successful politicians who universally commanded all the people uniformly throughout life, like Mahatma M. K. Gandhi, were born in Libra.  
Further, these people do not believe in hot discussions; but they will try to bring about compromise in all controversial matters. This is one of the main reasons why they come to the front, become popular, and prosperous. Another good quality in them is that they have an unassuming nature and humanitarian instincts. Even when they commit any mistake, it is such that will be easily forgiven. They generally lean more to the spiritual side than to the pure physical one.  
As Libra is a masculine sign and the seventh of the Zodiac (seventh house indicates marriage partner), the Librans have such strong conjugal affection that they do not consider anything else more important than this pleasure. This is the difference between Leo-borns and Librans. Librans are very affectionate and gentle. They are easy-going, remarkably shrewd, and never hurt others' feelings. They will not bully and bluster. They are persuasive. Being a masculine sign, one cannot impose upon Librans, who will defeat the opponent by adopting a peaceful and strategic plan. They are accomplished diplomats.  
The Librans enjoy life immensely in the company of the opposite sex. Mars, as lord of 2, offers "no fears". Hence, they argue with clarity and forethought. They have the capacity to handle any situation tactfully. Neat touch and fine finish are the traits of Librans. They have warmth and charming manners, so that they happen to be the peace-makers. Venus, the lord of the sign, indicates that Librans will take interest in their dress, furniture, conveyance, and other comforts. The number one concern for them is to keep the partner always in good cheer. The partner will attach importance to the spirit of love among the two, whereas Librans care more for the surrounding conditions.  
Venusians generally like music, especially romantic music, if Venus or Libra receives aspects from Mars. Saturn, aspecting or occupying Libra, shows interest in tragic ones. Jupiter indicates prayers. Moon shows melody and they will keep the audience spell-bound.  

Characteristics to be corrected

Generally, Libra-borns gain materially either through fortune or the goodwill and generosity of an affectionate and influential associate. Therefore, they must keep their emotions in check and not allow things to get out of hand. They should also avoid appointing the opposite sex as their private secretary, as this will waste much of their time. Librans often mix business and pleasure, which need not be elaborated. Furthermore, they should try to take quick decisions, as many ideas will flash in their mind quickly. They should also avoid copying mannerisms from others and gaudiness. As Librans are unassuming and amiable, others may try to fool them; they should deal with such associates carefully, but remember to forgive, though not to forget. Librans may feel that every new occasion demands a new dress, and thus spend much on costumes, not realising that God has given them charm and that adornment is not required in their case.

Health

Generally, Librans have good physical structure, but they lack normal immunity and resistance to infectious diseases, making them susceptible to such illnesses. To prevent this, they must take preventive measures. Libra is associated with the kidneys, loins, and spines, so one can expect defects in the kidneys, pain in the spines, and other issues. For women, the uterus may be affected. When Libra is associated with a disease, one may suffer from appendicitis, lumbago, and polyuria.

Finance and Fortune

Librans are best suited for business with a partner, as they excel in reasoning, logic, foresight, and judgment. They can provide the right advice at the right time. They are also well-suited for law, as they are admirable critics. The tenth house, ruled by the Moon, suggests that their occupation may involve liquids, such as druggists, chemists, painters, engineers in hydro-electric systems, transport, navy, or those dealing in food, milk, or juicy fruits. As Libra is an airy sign ruled by Venus, those born in this sign or with Libra as one of the houses (2, 6, 10) from the ascendant may be story writers, playback musicians, architects, nursery owners, or those in the airways service. Librans have an irresistible power of persuasion, making them good salesmen, liaison officers, and receptionists.

Expenses

Librans have a different idea of what is needed, which can lead to extravagance. They spend on luxuries and curios, and are rarely economical. As a result, a lot of money may pass through their hands. They are generous and liberal, and will donate to good causes.

Domestic Environment

Their family life will be happy because Librans try to maintain peace. Their houses will be well-furnished and all luxuries will be made available. Decorations, designs, and paintings will be of high standard. Costly ornaments will be in their possession. They always prefer to lead pleasant lives and enjoy all the fruits of life. They love their home, family, and property. Generally, the parents of natives born in Libra will rush home from their office, mostly to spend time at home with their little group. They will not normally give interviews to their subordinates or customers at their residence; they will finish everything in their office.

Friends and Benefactors

The Librans are ever-lasting good friends to all those who come in contact with them. For they are honest, just, kind, courteous, and generous; they easily make friendships with others. Without friends, they cannot pass their time. Sun, as lord of 11, shows that they will have much to do with government servants, officials, etc. They will lead mostly a public life with both social and financial success. As they do not hurt others, even when their friends misbehave, they quickly forgive. So naturally, they gain ultimately. Socially, they are always in great demand. Well-aspected Sun gives them benefit through those born on Sundays or in Leo Ascendant, or Karthikai, Uthra Palguni or Uthrashadha star days. They will waste money on those born on Punarvasu, Visakha, Poorva Pathrapada stars and Aslesha, Jyeshta, and Revathi stars. For people born in these six stars cannot be helpful.

Romance and Marriage

Librans are the most lovable people for sex-life. For, they are experts in all love affairs. By this sincere love, they capture their partners. Besides, their dress, fashion, pleasant perfumery, and sweet smile are very enticing. Librans' passion grows suddenly and dies out quickly being a movable sign. But, at the time the Libran enjoys, they enjoy immensely in the company of the opposite sex. Being pleasant conversationalists, they put their argument with clear vision as they find pleasure in good discussions. Girls born in Libra are ready to let the male do all the disagreeable ones. They like to do such acts and will never fail to thank with a smile.  
Librans marry early in their life. They preserve the tradition. They are happy both at home and also in social life. Their standard of living being high, sometimes they cannot have a partner who can satisfy them.  
Libra girls are intelligent, tactful, and wise. They avoid hot discussions and try to maintain peace. Libra ladies lead luxurious lives. They love and adore their partners.  
Libra men are cheerful, happy, compassionate, and adjusting. They will accommodate to a good extent. They will provide the family with all necessaries, comforts, luxuries, and conveniences. They are highly passionate and they reach the greatest heights in expressing their love. If, per chance, the response is not to their expectation, they feel very much disappointed. But generally, they do not seek divorce but try to adjust. As houses 2, 7, and 11 indicate the partner in life and the house 2 and 7 are ruled by Mars and 11 by Sun, the partner in life will be short-tempered and rash. They may listen to the Librans but do just as they desire. They will be mostly of Martian type. Hence Libra-borns have to tone down the partner's fiery nature and by their diplomacy and tact, maintain peace at home. Those who are born in Gemini and Aquarius will match the Librans very well. Pisces, Capricorn, and Cancer will not agree with them. Librans will manage with others.  

Children

Since the fifth house is ruled by the planet Saturn, normally the Libra-borns will have a limited number of children. As Saturn is a dutiful planet, the children of Libra-borns will help them in their old age. Librans, by their charm and pleasing manners, can see that the children carry out their instructions with pleasure. If children are born in the exalted sign of Saturn, i.e. Libra, they will be renowned for their diplomacy. They will never quarrel. They will pay heed to others, understand their views, and try to adopt them if they suit them. They are never 'extremes'. They are moderate. They cannot be partial. They are very polite and modest. They know to always say 'yes' and they avoid saying 'no' to anybody.

Lucky Day

Sundays and Mondays are the successful days, when you will be fortunate. Saturdays show ultimate and grand success as it owns both the Kendhra and Kona houses and it becomes a benefic by lordship. Tuesdays are auspicious for competition, litigation, election, and speculation. Sudden and unexpected advantages will occur on those days. Wednesdays show long journeys, contact with foreigners, feasts, social functions, and pleasant expenses. Thursdays are evil; there will be misunderstanding with cousins, colleagues, and others. But this day is auspicious to apply for overdraft facility, etc. Fridays offer mixed results.

Lucky Colour

Orange, white, and red. Green and yellow should be avoided. Orange colour gives easy gain without any pain. Pearls and orange are favourable for speculative profit. Do not use blue when you speculate. Blue will assist your opponent as Capricorn and Aquarius are the 10th and 11th houses to the opponent indicated by Aries. Red colour is good for marriage and competition. Yellow threatens misunderstanding and dispute. Green shows only withdrawal of money and deterioration of bank position.

Lucky Number

1, 10, 19, 28, 37, etc.; 4, 13, 22, 31, 40, etc.; 2, 11, 20, 29, 38, 47, etc.; 7, 16, 25, 34, 43, etc. Number 5 is for loss; 6 also threatens success to opponent; 8 indicates investment and profit to one with whom Librans transact; 3 brings enmity; 9 may lead to litigation. But finally, it promises success. Some are of opinion that Venus being the lord of the ascendant, Friday Number 6, and diamond are lucky. But it is not correct as Venus rules the 8th house also (although in Jataka Chandrika it is said that Venus does not become a malefic by owning the 8th house). Experience has shown that this rule applies only to longevity and not for any other aspect in one's life. So Venus as lord of 8 will throw obstacles; one may have any danger due to the lordship of the 8th house. As lord of the ascendant, it saves. But Venus does not give a smooth life.

Objects Indicated by Libra

Libra indicates the prices of cotton and textiles, silks and fabrics like rayons, linen, nylon; and also the prices of wheat, jute, canes, and grains. Finished goods and foodstuffs are indicated by Virgo.

Places

Libra denotes sawpits, ground near windmills, outhouses, inner chamber, sides of hills, places having a pure, clear, sharp air, mountain tops, etc.

Towns

Antwerp, Nottingham, Leeds, Frankfurt, Lisbon, Vienna, Charles Town, Petrograd, Copenhagen, Spires, Playenya Fribourg, Suessa, Johannesburg, and Gaeta.

Countries

Northern Provinces of India, Burma, Mo-China, China, Argentina Republic, parts of Tibet, Upper Egypt, Libya, Uzbek, Savoy, Austria, Bactrianna, and Livonia.

### Scorpio or Vrischika
Scorpio is the 8th sign of the Zodiac, extending from the 210th degree from the Vernal Equinox (Aries Mesha 0) to 240. The Sun will be moving away from the celestial equator towards the south. The constellation or the nakshathras Visakam 4th quarter, Anuradha, and Jyeshta are contained in this sign, Vrischika. The concluding part of this sign, Kataka and Meena, is termed Bhasandhi and Riksha Sandhi.  
Scorpio is the 2nd sign of Mars: the first sign governed by Mars is a barren, masculine, positive, cardinal, movable, fiery sign; the second is a fruitful, fixed, Sthira, feminine yet violent and a watery sign. It is of long ascension. Mars is the ruler of this sign. No planet gets exalted in this sign, but Moon becomes weakened and is debilitated. Scorpio is the sign of detriment to Venus. Modern scholars assign Scorpio as the exalted sign of Uranus (but considering the qualities of Uranus, it appeals to me that it would be appropriate to allot Virgo as the exalted sign to Uranus, just like Mercury). Sun and Jupiter are said to be in friend's quarters if they occupy Scorpio. Saturn, Mercury, and Venus are considered to be in enemy's camp when they pass in Scorpio.  
Scorpio is symbolised by a Scorpion. In snakes, there are venomous and non-venomous ones, but in Scorpions, there is no non-venomous one. All are evil. That is why Vrischika is called "Keeta" meaning reptile, representing the Poisonous scorpion. It is a centified sign. Hebrews ascribed Scorpio to Dan, a serpent. Originally, the banner of the Israel tribes was a Scorpion. Later, it was replaced by an Eagle. In Arabia, it is called "Al Akrab", meaning dispute and war; rupture and fall are attributed to Scorpio.  
Scorpio represents two types. The higher Scorpion type people have control over their senses ("Jithainthriyas"). That is why Lord Krishna stands on the venomous head of the "Kalinga" snake and keeps it under control. The lower type people will be jealous of others and rude. These are the indefatigable seekers after sensuous pleasure. They have strong will and they are irreconcilable. They know how to control others but they cannot control themselves and their senses.  

Physical Features

The body of a Scorpio is generally well-proportioned, with long hands and an above-average stature. They have a broad face, a commanding appearance, short and curly hair, and a muscular body. They have a good personality.

Characteristics

Scorpio is a fixed sign, making Scorpios particularly determined individuals. When they set a goal, they will not hesitate to plunge into the business and will not give up until they reach their target. They have a fertile imagination and sharp intelligence, and are full of dynamic energy when they are set into action. They have intense feelings and emotions, and remarkable intuition, making them successful in medical and financial fields. Mars, the owner of the sign, gives them self-assertion, impulsive action, courage, resolution, independence, excitement, and forcefulness. They are extremists, and can be both practical and reckless. They have a tendency to over-ride and keep others under control, and can quickly lose their temper. They are highly sexed, and may be drawn to the mysterious and psychic subjects. They hate gossip and loose talk, and are brief and choose their words carefully. They often put off things to the last moment, but are successful in the end. They do not interfere in others' matters, but will be revengeful and relentless if they feel betrayed. They are true, loyal, faithful, and reliable, but will keep one item of importance undisclosed. They can be cunning, and will always have a trump card to save themselves.

Characteristics to Be Corrected

Do not pass sarcastic remarks. Expect all your subordinates to be as clever and hardworking as you are, but do not be overly critical. Control yourself whenever you lose your temper. Try to avoid creating secret enmity with the ladies. Do not stand for foul play. Even if you lose, accept the loss; wait, and shortly you will regain what you have lost. Do not be selfish.

Health

Scorpio governs the generative organs, the bladder, which can cause disease; if they occupy Scorpio, they can affect the bladder, womb, ovaries, etc. Jupiter and Mars in Scorpio can lead to trouble by enlargement of the prostate gland. Venereal disease is the main disease caused by Scorpio. Stone in the bladder is mostly caused by Saturn. For people born in Scorpio, the 6th house from it is the sign which indicates the disease; therefore, the disease signified by Aries, the planets occupying Aries, those in the constellation of the occupants, those in the constellation of the lord of 6, and Mars can cause ailments. Therefore, affections of the brain, insomnia, neuralgia, coma, trance, inflammation, obsession, and somnambulism are signified by Aries.  
Scorpio being a fixed sign, the Moon is not only a Rajayoga adhipathi but also a Bhadhaka Sthana adhipathi. Therefore, the Moon can cause anxious ill-health to those born in Scorpio. Jupiter and Venus are Maraka Sthana adhipathis. (6th house disease; 2, 7, and 8 danger).

Finance and Fortune

Scorpio indicates chemistry, medicine, insurance, maternity, beverage, breweries, boilers, steam engines, automobiles, mines, military, water supply, dam construction, tools, machinery, slaughterhouses, labour department, tea, coffee, tobacco, copper, tin, parboiled rice, jaggery, mine ores, horses, and elephants, to excavate and catch elephants, etc. Greatest surgeons, chemists, research workers, detectives, and intelligent workers are born in this sign. Soldiers, dentists, barbers, butchers, those who work with iron and steel, rail loading, applied mechanics, military, and naval activity are also indicated by Scorpio. Generally, Scorpio-borns are lucky when it comes to money. In speculation, they will invariably gain, as the lord of 2 is also the lord of 5. Eventually, their income will be substantial. They are always lucky in anything they want, such as vehicles, wives, businesses, houses, gardens, and cattle, etc. They know how to make money, but they do not know how to save it. They are extravagant. They will be very kind and generous to them.

Domestic Environment

For your life to be jolly and successful in your career, environment plays a vital part. You want others to implicitly follow whatever you say in any matter, but you do not want anyone to boss over you. You are happy to boss over others and you cannot lead your life without all comforts and conveniences. You often spend beyond your capacity, expecting some income, and you will spend away in advance, wait for the returns, and repay the loan. You want to design your home to your taste and, even during adverse periods, you accept the situations and turn them to your advantage, creating happiness and proving to be successful and happier than others placed under similar conditions.

Friends and Benefactors

Scorpio-borns can become very intimate with someone in a short period of time when they make a friendship, but if there is any friction, they can become a worse enemy. Because of this, Scorpio-borns do not have life-long friends. However, the friends they choose will be in positions of power and authority, or they will be influential. If someone adjusts and gets close to them, they can benefit from them and can expect a permanent tie of friendship. You should not be violent and should accept others' arguments. You should not show that you are convinced, but if you correct yourself, you will be very popular. Lower type Scorpio-borns will be notorious. Every action has a reaction and everyone is repaid in the same coin. The 11th house indicates friends and benefactors, and Mercury rules the 11th sign and also governs the 8th house. Therefore, Mercurians will not mind letting you down and bringing you disgrace if you make their friendship, be a good friend for some period, and then rub them on the wrong side. Therefore, do not take anyone into your confidence and at any unguarded moment leak out any of your secret matters.

Romance and Marriage

Scorpio-borns have complex moods; yet they are intense, dynamic, and energetic in romance and love affairs. Unless they have sympathy, good understanding, and steady affection and try to cultivate it, they cannot have a pleasant and smooth life with the opposite sex. This is true for most people, but especially for Scorpio-borns, who consider this world a heaven for them if they receive compliments and appreciation from their partner, and become depressed, disgusted, downcast, or broken down if their partner passes any criticism or does not approve of their actions. In spite of this, Scorpio-borns give all comforts to their partners and try to keep them in cheer and good spirits, expecting their partner to express their love and wanting demonstrations of affection.  
People born in Scorpio will enjoy their lives if their partners show a genuine affection and deep love. One is fortunate if they have a husband born in Scorpio, as they will lead a smooth life with people born in Pisces or Cancer, and agree with a husband born in Virgo or Capricorn. A Taurus husband will contribute to their happiness, as they know how to dance or adjust, so that any disharmony among themselves is not let known to anyone else. They care more for honor and family prestige. The difficulty with Scorpio-girls (only when the ascendant is afflicted) is that they work very hard, they are really true, but they suddenly lose their temper, forget themselves, and loudly retort without any consideration for the position of their husband.  
A Scorpio-woman with an afflicted ascendant once had her husband unusually consent to feed a very old poetess and philosopher when the latter made a humble request. With all humility, he very slowly and politely informed his wife. Imagine her reaction! Throughout the time she was engaged in preparing the dish, she was offering Sahasranama archana to her husband. Later, while serving the food, when he appealed to offer a little more to the old lady, she, without missing the aim, straight on his head broke the mud pot. The bottom being weak, gave way, but the mouth of the pot was strong, so she garlanded him with the ring of the mud pot.  
Another Scorpio-woman poured a cupful of boiling soup on the head of her husband when he mentioned that she forgot to use salt on that day and that the soup was flat and insipid. Therefore, it is a curse to marry a bride born in Scorpio with adverse aspects to her Lagna and Mars. One has to console themselves by saying "This is my lot; my fate". But if it receives good aspects or at least no bad aspects, one cannot get a better wife than Scorpio-borns. Similarly, Scorpio-gents will appreciate the qualities of their wives.

Children

Jupiter rules the second and fifth houses, while the eleventh house is governed by Mercury. Therefore, Jupiter and Mercury are the ruling planets of your children. Therefore, you will not mind having a large family and you do not support birth control, though you may preach it for others. However, you forget to practice what you preach. If Jupiter and Mercury are afflicted by the conjunction with or adverse aspect from malefics, you may not have any children at all, or you may only have one issue, mostly a daughter. Generally, Jupiter, the chief governor for children, and Mercury, the planet for plurality, being the lords of the second, fifth, and eleventh houses, will increase the number of members of the family to a good extent. The children will not only be intelligent, but also lucky.

Lucky Days

Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays are successful days. Sundays promise steady fortune; Mondays will keep you in good spirits and you will rejoice. They are heydays. Thursdays presage fortune. Tuesdays bless you with health and victory will be had on Tuesdays. Fridays show social success and deterioration of bank position. Wednesdays may cause anxiety through friends. Saturdays dishearten you.
For profession, meet the influential people on Sundays. Compete with others on Tuesdays (suppose you are losing popularity but yet you are in power, have the meeting to elect the President or a Secretary to the association, society or club on Tuesdays. Victory is yours especially when Chithrai star first half is transited by Moon). Transact with foreigners or make journey on Mondays. Marry on Thursdays and open account in the Bank on Thursdays. Repay loan on a Saturday, especially when Moon transits in Anuradha star and in the Ascendant you have Mandhi. Never sign any important document on Wednesdays. If you want to save money, avoid commitments on Fridays.

Lucky Colours

Yellow, red, orange, and cream are favourable. If you have no child or if you want sound bank position, use yellow sapphire on a pure gold ring. If you have any litigation, have ruby. Success is yours. If you want to have higher studies or to go overseas, use cream coloured pearls. For steady prosperity in your career, use light red or orange colour. Avoid blue, pure white, and green.

### Sagittarius - Dhanus
Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the Zodiac, extending from the 240th degree from the Vernal Equinox (Aries). The constellations Moolam, Poorvashada, and Uthrashada first quarter are contained in this sign.  
According to the Sayana System, the Sun enters Sagittarius around the 23rd of November and leaves it around the 22nd of December. The Sun moves daily, approximately one degree and one minute. Therefore, those born between the 23rd of November and the 22nd of December will have their horoscopes erected by the Sayana System with the Sun marked in Sagittarius.  
According to the Nirayana System, throughout Kaliyuga, the Sun will enter Sagittarius on the 15th of December and will leave it on the 14th of January every year. Therefore, those born between the 15th of December and the 14th of January will have their horoscopes erected according to the Nirayana System with the Sun marked in Sagittarius.  
Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the Zodiac, but it is the first sign governed by Jupiter. It is a fiery sign, fixed, common, positive, masculine, hot, and dry, dual-double bodied (the first half, Dhanus, is human; the second half is animal-bestial). It is of long ascension. Jupiter is the ruler of this sign. No planet gets exalted in Sagittarius, nor does any become debilitated here, but Mercury is said to have its detriment, i.e. weak, in this sign. Sun, Moon, and Mars are said to occupy their friend's house when they are in this sign, while Saturn, Venus, and Mercury are considered to be in an enemy's camp when they are in Sagittarius.  
Sagittarius is pictured as half-man with bow and arrow and half horse. "Two birds at a shot" is indicated by Dhanus. Its ruler is Jupiter, Jehovah, the Saviour. If one is suffering from any disease or meets with an accident, his life will be saved and hence it is said that Jupiter's favourable aspect means that one will enjoy "Providential Help". "If Jupiter is with you nothing can go against your interests".  

Physical Features

A well-proportioned and well-developed body; tall, with a large forehead, high and bushy eyebrows, a long nose, bright eyes, a charming appearance, a graceful look, a fair complexion, and a handsome figure.

Characteristics of Sagittarius

Sagittarius is a fiery sign, hence those born under this sign will be bold, courageous, and determined. They will be ambitious, greedy, and aspiring, and will always look on the bright side of things. They will not be timid, and will not flutter or fear and tremble even in adverse conditions. They will be dauntless and have self-confidence, and will work against odds. They are at their best only when there are obstacles. Fiery sign gives them energy, enthusiasm, vigour, and vitality.  
Being a common sign, Sagittarians will weigh the merits and demerits of each case and finally take a decision. They will be impulsive and rash, unlike Aries people who act after deep consideration. They may delay to start a work or undertake any venture, because they would have taken time to contemplate, plan, and scheme.  
Being a masculine sign, Sagittarians do not hesitate much to think, speak out, or act as they desire. They love only truth and will hold on to their principles to the last, even though they are aware that their action may bring unpleasant results. They will speak out what they feel is right, without considering how others will relish such statements.  
As the ninth sign of the Zodiac, Sagittarians will try to have higher education. They are fond of long travel and have the desire to develop friendships with foreigners. They are highly philosophical, religious-minded, and God-fearing. Jupiter, being the lord of the sign, gives them a broad mind, confidence, truth, and spiritual uplift. They will be fond of sport, and their outstanding features are justice, sympathy, and courage. They will have a quick grasp and retentive power, as the ninth and tenth houses to Sagittarius are governed by the Sun and Mercury, which are mostly found in one sign causing Nipuna yoga. Therefore, Sagittarians understand quickly and assimilate new ideas. Their intuition will be correct, and they are for justice. If they find that someone has been done injustice, they will fight and arrange for the victim to gain their rightful claims.  
Venus generally indicates what one will like most. As Venus owns the sixth house, Sagittarians will have dogs and other pet animals. As lord of the eleventh house, they will have many benefactors. They desire to be in the midst of the opposite sex and make friendships in a moment, which they maintain for a long number of years. As the Moon owns the eighth house, they will have unnecessary distrust and will change their opinion often.  

Characteristics to be Corrected

If the ascendant or the planet in the ascendant is afflicted, even though you are mostly good, your behaviour may occasionally be inconsiderate. You may lack tact and exaggerate or speak without truth. You may make promises that you do not keep. Do not insult or hurt others by giving your opinion, even if you are correct. Be moderate and do not develop hatred towards your parents and brothers.

Health

Sagittarius governs the hips, the thighs, the loins, ilium, femur, buttocks, glutinous muscles, sacral arteries, etc. Hence one may suffer from sciatica, rheumatic pain, fracture in the hip, lumbago, gout, eusonophilia, and lung trouble. Mars and Saturn in Sagittarius can cause fracture of the bones as well as ulcer in the thigh needing the surgeon's aid. Jupiter in Dhanus threatens the native with gout and pulmonary apoplexy. Jupiter in Poorvashada star causes diabetes. Saturn alone indicates contusions of the hips, T.B., chronic pulmonary disease, and asthma. The Moon indicates bronchitis, pneumonia, and diabetes. The Sun causes defective hearing and poor vision. Venus indicates tumour and diabetes. Mercury shows hiccough, asthma, etc. To Sagittarius, Mercury is a Rajyogadhipathi, owning the 10th house. It is also the Bhadhaka Sthana adhipathi, owning the 7th house, as Sagittarius is a common sign. To chara rasi, 11th house; to fixed rasi 9th house; to common sign 7th house, Mercury is a Kendhrathipathi (houses 1, 4, 7, and 10 are called Kendhra Sthanas). As houses 2 and 7 are termed as Maraka Sthanas, Mercury owning the seventh house is the strongest evil, other than Rajayoga adhipathyam, to cause fatal disease.

Finance and Fortune

Being a fiery sign, you do not like others ordering you, nor do you prefer to sit tight in one place and work. You desire frequent changes and fare well when given a free hand. As Jupiter rules this sign, you may be a teacher, public speaker, bank employee, or one attached to any religious institution. Politics may prove to be lucky if Jupiter is not afflicted. Mercury, being lord of 10, indicates that you may edit, publish, and have larger income through advertisement. You may be a good auditor and master Company-law. You may work in foreign embassy or in foreign affairs. Planets in any manner connected with houses 2, 6, or 10 occupying Sagittarius can offer one service in mines, transport, and engineering. Speculation may not be helpful and profitable to Sagittarians, as lord of 5 is also lord of 12. However, those who have the lords of 1, 2, 3, 6, and 11 posited in Poorvashada star may get rich quickly and have gains without pains.

Domestic Environments

You do not like your close relatives, but you will be generous and friendly towards the opposite sex. You will spend a lot on your children, and those without children will spend on educational institutions or the renovation of temples, etc. You will be kind to others, but not to your family. At home, you may feel a lack of independence, even though the fourth house is owned by the lord of the ascendant.

Finance and Benefactors

It is not difficult for you to make friends. You may have some silly quarrels with a stranger, but you will develop a permanent friendship with them. It is similar to a passenger who takes a seat in the second class of a train and fights with someone who tries to get in. Eventually, they become good friends. Sagittarians and Gemini-born people will make friends easily. The eleventh house shows friends and benefactors, while the sixth house indicates enmity and open quarrels. To Gemini-borns, Mars is the lord of the sixth and eleventh houses, and to Sagittarius-borns, Venus is the lord of the sixth and eleventh houses. You will be liked by your friends due to your sweet smile and quick wit. People born on Fridays, in Taurus and Libra, or in the nakshatras Barani, Poorvapalguni, and Poorvashada will be your long-standing friends. Those born in Hastham star may bring ill-repute to you, as the lord of the eighth house will be in the constellation of the lord of the eighth house in the tenth house.

Romance and Marriage

If you are a male, your wife should be wise and tactful, as your temper may flare up quickly, but only for a short time. You may be interested in games, sports, and society clubs, which may make it appear as though your family life is not important to you. Your wife should be broadminded, adjusting, and accommodative. If you marry a girl born in Sagittarius, you will be lucky. She will be calm, clever, competent, and considerate. The second, seventh, and eleventh houses indicate the partner. If Saturn, Mercury, and Venus are well-posited and not adversely aspected by Mars, they will give you a reliable, faithful, dutiful, pleasant, and intelligent wife. If Mars afflicts the lords of the second and eleventh houses, then the partner may have contact with more than one.

Children

Houses 2, 5 and 11 indicate the birth of children. So Saturn, Mars and Venus are the lords. Your children will not be fondled by you when they are young, but as they age, you will take much interest in them. You should not allow them to feel that you doubt their behaviour, movements, etc. If you curb their independence, they may become more obstinate and strong-willed. It will not be possible for you to correct them, so you must be very tactful in dealing with your children.

Lucky Days

Wednesdays and Fridays are very lucky. Thursdays promise success. Mondays cause anxiety and troubles. Tuesdays show extravagant expenses and loss. Sundays are pleasant and prosperous. Saturdays indicate slow, steady progress and assistance from others. Speculate on Fridays. If there is an election, have the polling on Fridays. For litigation, Fridays and Saturdays are successful ones. Sign contracts on Wednesdays. Avoid Mondays and Tuesdays. Make long journeys on Sundays. Write examinations on Thursdays or interview officials on Thursdays and Fridays. Do shanthi, prayer, homa, etc. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

Lucky Colour

White, cream, green, orange and light blue. Avoid red and pearls. Emerald bestows on you name, fame, reputation, larger yield from investment, promotion and prosperity. White cream shades show success in litigation, victory over enemies, pleasure and profit. Orange colour is auspicious for assistance from government, connections with foreigners and for long journeys. Light blue indicates increase in self-acquisition, good understanding with colleagues, support from people in authority and power. If you use ruby and red colour, it may make you more short-tempered, rash and reckless, resulting in great loss.

Lucky Numbers

6, 5, 3 and 8. Of these 6 and 8 are for finance, family and fortune. Avoid 2, 7 and 9.

Objects Indicated by Sagittarius

Moolam constellation governs medicine, physicians, flowers, roots, fruits, seeds, etc. Poorvashada shows fish, aquatic animals, aquatic fruits and flowers. Uthrashada in Sagittarius indicates horses, elephants, warriors, etc. (Brihat Samhita) arrows; spears; swords; needles, poles, sticks, canes, rope, race horses, tooth picks, crowbars, drills, chisels, ayurvedic medicinal herbs, etc.

Places

Hills, in a house the topmost room, places next to the oven, stables of healthy horses, receptacles for cattle, places where ammunition is stored and weapons are preserved, churches, temples, schools and colleges, courts, woods and bushes.

Countries

Australia, Arabia, Madagascar, Hungary, Sclaronia, Tuscany, Spain, Istria, Dalmatia, Italy.

Towns

Naples, Narbonne, Stutland, Avignon, Sheffield, Rottenberg, Cologne, Buda, Bradford, West Bromwich, Torouts, Toledo, Portland, Nottingham.

### Capricorn-Makara
Capricorn is the tenth sign of the Zodiac. It extends from 270th degree from the Vernal Equinox (Aries 0 - Mesha 0) to 300th degree. This is when the Sun has reached the southernmost point in its path (called the ecliptic) and takes the northern course from 270th degree. It is popularly known as Makara Sankranthi. When the Sun is in the 270th degree counted from the Vernal equinox, it is exactly half a day for those in the South Pole and the other half of the day is yet to run. For people in the North pole, it is exact midnight. The Nakshathras or the constellation Uthrashada second, third and fourth quarters, Sravanam, Dhanishta first and second padas are contained in this sign, Capricorn-Makara.  
According to Sayana system, the Sun, nowadays, enters Capricorn on or around 22nd December every year and leaves Capricorn on or around 21st January. The Sun moves daily approximately 18' to 11'. To those who are born between 23rd December and 21st January, any year, horoscopes cast by following Sayana system, the Sun will be shown in the sign Capricorn. But, according to Nirayana system, throughout Kaliyuga, the Sun will enter Capricorn or Makara on the 14th January and leave Nirayana Capricorn on or around 12th February every year. If the charts are erected, following stellar astrology or Nirayana system, Sun will be marked in Capricorn in the horoscopes of the persons born between 14th January and 12th February, both days inclusive.  
Capricorn-Makara is the 10th sign of the Zodiac and is the first sign governed by Saturn. The other sign which Saturn owns is called Aquarius and is next to Capricorn. Capricorn is a chara-movable-cardinal, solstitial, tropical, negative, feminine, earthy, dry, cold, quadrupedal, persevering, despondent sign of short-ascension in the southern-hemisphere. Saturn gets debilitated in the sign (owned by Mars) Aries-Mesha, but Mars gets exalted in the sign (owned by Saturn) in Capricorn-Makara. Jupiter gets debilitated in this sign. Whenever Capricorn is occupied by both the luminaries Sun and Moon, they are said to be in enemy's camp. But Venus and Mercury are considered to occupy the friend's residence when they are in Capricorn.  
Capricorn is the sign of sacrifice. It is said that at the time of the birth of Jesus, the Sun had just entered Capricorn which is the symbol of resurrection. Even today, in India, the goat is the sacrificial animal. Whosoever that sacrifices himself is a Capricornian. The popular saying, "He was the goat" is applicable to one born in Makara.  

Physical Features of Capricorn

Saturn, the lord of the sign, shows that one will be emaciated, weak, and grow slowly. The body will not be muscular or plump, but slender. One grows tall suddenly after 16 years of age, and as one advances in age, their constitution also improves. The face will be thin and oval, with a long nose and deep-set eyes. The hair will be coarse, and if Saturn is weak, there will not be sufficient growth of hair in the forehead. However, if Saturn is well-posited, there will be profuse growth. Saturn rules this sign and governs the osseous system in the body. If Saturn is ill-posited for those born in Capricorn, one may suffer from T.B. of the bones or mottled enamel or fluorine intoxication. As age advances, the person may become hunch-backed, and there may be a scar in the knee-cap or at least a mole.

Characteristics of Capricorn

Capricorn is an earthy sign, so the person will be economical, prudent, reasonable, thoughtful, methodical, and practical-minded. It confers a plodding, persevering, and patiently working temperament. The person will be calculative and business-like.  
Capricorn is a movable sign, so one will quickly execute any work after taking a decision carefully. They will have the push and confidence to make a thorough change in their career if it is found to be advantageous. They will have a special organizing capacity and with enormous tolerance, patience, and a steady nature, they will be at the head of certain projects, however large they may be.  
Being a feminine sign owned by Saturn, it gives one a reserved nature and fear of ridicule. They will not entertain any hope on others' promises, nor will they be optimistic until they come out successful or realize their ambition. It is not easy to cheat Capricornians.  
Further, the person will appear to be modest and polite. They will not make friendships quickly, but will take a long time to test an individual before making a permanent tie of friendship.  
Saturn, who owns this house, indicates that one will be either honest, sincere, and reliable or the most conceited, dishonest, selfish, greedy, and miserly, never hesitating to commit any crime. Purposeful Saturn shows that Capricornians will never spend their time in idle talk. Lethargic Saturn suggests that the person needs another person to kindle them to do a task. Normally, they will not take action then and there, but postpone it to the last moment. At the instance of another, they will start doing the job, and once they take it up, they will be at it until it is finished. Delaying Saturn may not confer success on them immediately, but like Robert Bruce, they will make repeated attempts and will finally come out successful. If they are given encouragement, they will complete the work with enthusiasm. Obstacles and hindrances will depress them for some time, but they will not leave it.  
People who dive in the sea and mine excavators are governed by Saturn or Capricorn. Till they find the spring, they will be digging the well. Further, it shows that one will utilize everything to a material purpose.  
Generally, Venus presages those which one will desire to have. As it owns the houses 5 and 10, and since Saturn owns the sign Capricorn, they will try to have pleasurable pursuits, will be fond of music, drama, cinema, etc., will speculate, will have a proper Guru (Preceptor) to initiate them a 'Mantra', and will be fortunate to have success.  
Moon owns the seventh house, so one will be always having a company. Otherwise, there will be depression. Whenever they work, study, or travel, they will have the company of a friend to keep themselves cheerful and active.  
This sign also produces many great men, especially in politics. Saturn in the tenth house will be exalted. In certain sub in Libra, Saturn gains such an influence that Capricorns having Saturn in such positions will think something, speak something, and do something else. They will be highly tactful, diplomatic, clever, cunning, and selfish and will not be grateful to any. While Mercury gives the native the power to remember one and all before election and totally forget immediately after selection, a good aspect between Saturn and Mercury in the horoscope of such persons is a fortune to the country as they will work for others. They will not have any favoritism and will abide by the moral law. The disadvantage is that they will be slow and steady in their ventures, but with the blessing of the Providence, they will ultimately have grand success.  

Characteristics to be Corrected

If either the ascendant in Capricorn or the lord of the ascendant, Saturn, receives bad aspects from any other planet, the native will likely be selfish and egoistic, rarely optimistic and mostly pessimistic, desperate and broken-hearted, and prone to overworking and exerting too much. Due to overstrain, they will feel fatigued.  
Hence, the native should strive to correct themselves after understanding that they may not be aware of their faults or defects and that one born in Capricorn will have the above undesirable characteristics. They should develop dignity and diplomacy, avoid nervousness and discontent.

Health

Capricorn governs the knees and the patella bones, and Saturn signifies the complete bony structure. Capricorn also governs the dry epidermis, so injuries to the part of the body near the knee cap, such as urticaria, skin diseases, eczema, bruises, and dislocations, are indicated when the lord of the sixth house occupies Capricorn and when malefics are in the ascendant in Capricorn. Saturn in Uthrashada threatens murmur of the heart, while Mars in Uthrashada shows cardiac thrombosis. Rahu and Kethu in Uthrashada cause blood pressure, and Uranus causes heart failure. Planets in Sravanam star show affection of the lungs, eczema, etc., while planets in Dhanishta threaten high fever, bronchitis, pneumonia, urticaria, bruises, fractures, and dislocations.
Hysteria, rheumatism, and cold are indicated by the owner of this sign, Saturn. As people born in this sign will be depressed and discontented, worried and gloomy, gradually the digestive system will become weak and it may cause flatulence. Capricorn opposing Cancer may cause pulmonary affection and in 6 to Leo may cause trouble to the heart. In a large number of horoscopes, it was found that evil planets in Capricorn affect the heart of the native during the period of the malefic occupying Capricorn.
It is advantageous to be in the midst of cheerful youngsters, take heating and stimulating food, include laxatives, have regular physical exercise, never jump and fall down, and avoid high jump and pole jump. The second and seventh houses are Maraka Sthanas, and even though Saturn is the lord of the ascendant, as he is, by nature, the chief governor for longevity and as he also owns the second house, Aquarius, the Maraka-Sthana, Saturn will end one's life. The seventh house is owned by Moon, so Mars, Saturn, and Moon are evil and they will cause death. Sun, who owns Leo, the eighth house, does not become evil due to its lordship Jataka-chandrika. By that, one is to understand that unless Sun gains evil results by conjoining with or being aspected by Saturn, Mars, and Moon, it will not cause death.
Mercury, lord of the sixth house, will affect health. Hence Vitamin B deficiency, gas trouble, and general nervous debility may be expected during the periods and sub-periods of Mercury. One is to understand clearly that Saturn, Mars, and Moon will cause danger and anxiety to one's longevity in their conjoined sub-periods in the major period of the evil planet, while Mercury will repeatedly give, more or less, the same diseases.

Finance and Fortune

Capricorn-borns are conservative and will never mind difficulties, handicaps, and hindrances; they will continue to work in the same direction until they come out successful. Their ambition drives them to persevere and they have the desire to gain name, fame, reputation, and money. They will try to avail of all opportunities arising and consolidate all their affairs and resources. As a business person born in any of the 12 signs during Jupiter dasa, they will be going on expanding their business and opening many branches in different parts. However, during Saturn dasa and during the dasa of planets in Capricorn, they will consolidate and concentrate. They are pessimistic by nature and do not speculate; they will invest in permanent possessions after carefully scrutinizing the documents and obtaining enough security. They are industrious and save money slowly and steadily. As long as they do not speculate, take chances, and risks, they cannot expect a windfall. They do not waste money and if they serve others, they will prove to be most economical, correct, trustworthy, well-informed, and wide-awake workers. They are best fitted to serve in the Finance Department and will always think of the future and save satisfactorily for the ‘rainy day’ or to meet unexpected and uncommon expenses.
Saturn being the lord of Capricorn and also the second house, the native may deal in or serve in such things as are mentioned below. Further, good aspects from planets to the ascendant or to the lord of the ascendant, Saturn, indicate the following professions. Sun forming good aspect indicates service in quasi-government, municipality, local boards, Corporation, or Government, dealing in mine ores, or organizing and managing big institutions. The native will invest money in wholesale business or invest in lands, buildings, etc., which may be let out for rent for Government use. Moon forming good aspect shows that the person will deal with kerosene, lands, and animals and will be a successful agriculturist. They may excavate wells, build tanks, or may be a contractor to reinforce the bund of lakes, etc. Mars forming favorable aspect is necessary for engravers of metal, masons, engineers, surveyors, cement manufacturers (Venus also must form aspect for cement and leather manufacture), surgeons (Sun too), lawyers (Jupiter also), brick-kiln owners, etc. Mercury forming good aspect produces engineers, detective novel writers, deep thinkers, teachers (Mathematics, Physics), dealers in scientific instruments, and gives chances to work in C.I.D. department (Mars also). It produces experts in handprint, forgery; it is advantageous to those who practice concentration, crystal-gazing yoga, etc. Jupiter forming good aspect shows that one may be a physician or a scientist. One may gain through clubs and societies, manage large companies, or serve Religious Endowment Board. They may take contracts on a long-term basis. Venus forming good aspect makes one patient and honest, steady and sincere. They may deal in chemical, mine ores, leather and hides, or may serve in slaughter house, birth control; may be a sanyasi without any attraction to the opposite sex. They may invest their money on gardens and lands. The people working in the cremation or burial ground will also have this aspect. [Purohits, having good aspect between Jupiter and Venus are experts in conducting a marriage whereas Purohits having good aspect between Saturn and Venus are conversant with disposals]. Uranus forming good aspect gives good knowledge in occult sciences; the person is an expert in mental healing or healing without any drug. They may serve in the Railway; they may practice astrology or study Geology; they will be interested in collecting curios, in preserving monuments, etc. (Venus also). Neptune forming good aspect shows success in secret service, submarine liquids, oils, sub-soil materials, etc. They should not overtrade; then they will be successful. Long journeys on land or sea will prove to be advantageous.

Domestic Environments

Generally, Capricorn-borns are not very eager to get married early. But they do marry, because they feel they have to and are destined to. They do not want many children, yet they often become the parents of a large family. They never fail to do their duty and they do love their wives and children, but they do not display their love, so the children may mistake their Capricorn parents for treating them coldly.
They collect things which are beautiful and will try to have a library of their own. They hate noise but want a quiet atmosphere and privacy. They prefer seclusion and peace, which can lead their family members to mistakenly believe they are cold.
Even if the wife (or husband) is argumentative and quarrelsome, he (or she) will mostly be absent from the scene and avoid retorting; the fire of anger will have its own natural death. This is because they care for the prestige and honour of a family life, even if their partner is bent on doing harm.

Friends and Benefactors: Normally, the native does not take anyone into his confidence, but he will be known to many and have a large number of acquaintances. Good friends will be few only. He will be true to his friends and respect them throughout life. As he can keep others cheerful with his witty conversation, he is best suited to be an active member of societies and clubs. He will find that those born on Tuesdays in the sign Scorpio or in the three stars Mrigasirisha, Chithra and Dhanishta are his benefactors. They will never hesitate to lend him assistance; in fact, he will realise that they help him even without his asking for it. He will also find that people born in Bharani, Poorvapalguni and Poorvashada stars are very helpful to him.

As the lord of 11 also owns the 4th house, he may receive benefits through his mother. Co-tenants will co-operate. The author strongly advises Capricornians to take buildings on a rental basis and sublet a portion of it for the total rental value. Thus, they can live in the same premises without paying any rent.

Romance and Marriage: Even though the native may have affection, he will never give expression to it nor will he be fit for romance, dance, etc. He will not be emotional. He will be very slow and cautious when he approaches the other sex. He will not be bold or rash; never will he take the lead. He will ask the other very tactfully, obtain her consent once, twice and even thrice and even then, he will be afraid to proceed further. The other sex will be worried by the hesitancy of the man born in Capricorn.

Anyhow, it is true that he will take a long time to choose his partner. Houses 2, 7 and 11 indicate marriage. The lords of the signs are Saturn, Moon and Mars. Find out which is the strongest in your horoscope. The features, the characteristics, etc., will be governed by the strongest of the three.
If the lord of 2, Saturn, is strong and well-posited, the marriage will take place during Saturn's sub-period. The partner will be selfish but will be very economical. She will not permit the native to spend money; she will observe the tradition and custom of the family and she will be industrious.
If Moon, the lord of 7, is very strong, the partner will be timid and poor in health. She will desire to have frequent changes of residence. She will be unsteady; yet, she will be much attached to the native and to the other members of the family. She will be sympathetic, patient, devoted and adaptable. She will need assistance from her husband and will prove to be most accommodating.
If Mars, the lord of 11, is the strongest of the three planets, the partner will be modern and masculine. She will prove to be an able and faithful wife; she will manage the whole family. She will be a hard worker, an excellent cook and an extravagant hostess. She will not give freedom to the person born in Capricorn. She will direct everything and maintain strict discipline. Marriage is generally fixed and celebrated suddenly at a very early age.

Children

Even though one may have many children, he should not fondle with them. He should do his duty and not mix with them or join in their play or allow them to make noise. He should want them to be quiet and attend to their work, and not allow his children to go beyond a limit. He should keep them under control, but at the same time not antagonize them. As years pass on, the children will understand that inwardly their father has strong affection for them, though he does not give expression to it, because the children will realize that their father considers their welfare as the first priority in his life and will work hard for their comforts and conveniences.

Lucky Days

Fridays, Tuesdays, and Saturdays are the best. Wednesdays are successful. Thursdays and Sundays show expenses. Mondays end in enmity or litigation. Speculate on Tuesdays and Fridays. Invest on Saturdays and sign documents on Tuesdays. Compete on Wednesdays and go on long journeys on Wednesdays. Avoid Mondays and Sundays. Pray to God or Goddess on Fridays or Tuesdays.

Lucky Colours

White, red, and blue are lucky colours. Avoid yellow and cream colours. White (diamond) gives lucky and beautiful children, speculative gains, success in music, cinema, drama, etc., success in pleasurable pursuits, politics, and profession. In business, one will have unexpected advantages, improvement, and assistance from government officials, etc. Red colour gives the native building, land, property, vehicle, and good friends. Blue colour is auspicious for health, long life, financial success, and a happy family life.

### Aquarius
Aquarius is the eleventh sign of the zodiac and extends from 30° of the vernal equinox (Aries 0° - Mesha 0°) to 30°. The sun is in its northern course during this time. The asterisms, Dhanishta later half, Sathabhisha, and Poorvapathra's first two and third padas (quarters) are contained in this sign. According to the Sayana system, the sun enters Aquarius on or around 21st January and leaves Aquarius on or around 19th February, moving daily approximately 1° 0' 54" to 1° 0' 16". In horoscopes erected according to the Sayana system, the sun will be shown in the sign Aquarius for people born during this time of the year. However, according to the Nirayana system, the sun will enter Aquarius on 13th February and leave it on 12th March each year. If the charts are erected for people born on any of the dates in this time of any year, the sun will be shown in Aquarius.  
Saturn owns two houses, Capricorn and Aquarius, and is the second sign governed by Saturn. Before the discovery of Uranus (Herschel), both the Hindu sages and the Western astrologers allotted this house to Saturn. After the discovery of Herschel, the Western savants allotted Aquarius to Uranus. No planet enjoys exaltation in this sign, nor does any planet suffer debilitation. However, this sign is a friendly one to Mercury and Venus, whereas it is said to be the enemy's camp for the other four planets: Sun, Moon, Mars, and Jupiter. Saturn is strong in this sign and the qualities ascribed to this sign agree with those of Uranus.  
Aquarius is symbolized by water pouring out from a vessel. The Hebrews called Aquarius "Delphi" meaning "water container". Aquarius is an airy sign with high humidity and represents mostly the rain from the air, as the air enveloping the earth evaporates the water on the earth, holds it in air, forms clouds, and pours as rain. In the human system, Aquarius is the distributor of water and gas, helping recovery from the sinking life and rejuvination with satisfactory strength, just like the perishing planets (e.g. grass) again regain life and we are delighted. Aquarius is called an airy, fixed, sthira, moist, positive, human, and voice sign. It is of short ascension.  

Physical Features

Though Aquarius is a sign of short ascension, people born under it are usually tall with a full stature. They are strong. Their faces are oval, their complexion fair, and their appearance is handsome. Of the twelve signs, Venus and Aquarius produce the most beautiful children. Their teeth may be defective, and their hair has a brown shade. There may also be a mole or scar on the calf muscle.

Characteristics of Aquarius

Aquarius is an airy sign, so Aquarians are usually intelligent and cannot be fooled by flattery. They can read the character of others and can detect the motives of others. Saturn, which rules the airy sign, shows that Aquarians consider the merits and demerits of every case slowly and carefully, so that they can observe what others do, watch and see the results, and then act. Though they are intelligent, they can be slow in grasping and absorbing new ideas, but they have a good retentive power and never forget.  
Being the eleventh sign of the zodiac, Aquarians have a broad outlook and human understanding, are outspoken, unselfish, humane, and impersonal. They are social, but they select their friends carefully and are silent workers in any society or club. They always make efforts to bring about harmony and to change any condition which is undesirable, unhealthy, or detrimental to further progress.  
Uranus, the other ruler of the sign, shows that Aquarians are shrewd, clear-headed, quick-witted, and wide-awake. They also have a desire to improve and raise the mental standard of all. They are often far ahead in fresh ideas, new thoughts, new approaches to problems, improved designs for living, etc. They have their own way of thinking and use their own discretion. They are not afraid to do anything unusual or irregular if they consider it to be morally right. Even in dress, they have their own individuality, mannerisms, peculiarities, and specialties.  
Aquarians have intuition and an inclination towards science. Being a fixed sign, they are very constant in their friendships and are usually persistent in all their undertakings, eventually succeeding. They are best suited for research work and are very strong in their likes and dislikes. They will go to great lengths to help their good friends, but cannot be pressured into doing something they do not agree with. They are stubborn, but not foolhardy.  
This house is the House of 'Kama', which generally means pleasure and pleasant union. However, the real meaning of 'Kama' is 'desire'. In the four Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha Purusharthas, Aquarius denotes 'Kama'. Leo-Simha, the fifth sign of the zodiac, has to show pleasurable pursuits for worldly life (Ikha-Loka-Sukha). But Para Loka Sadhana, being opposite to worldly pleasures, the kama sign for Para Loka Sadhana is Aquarius, which opposes the Ikha Loka Sukha pleasure sign, Leo-Simha. Aquarians have a desire to leave physical subject and develop intuition and inspiration. They prefer secluded deep meditation and good concentration, and may become ascetics at some point in their lives. They do not preach to others, but practice what they preach.  
Jupiter, the fortunate planet, owning the houses 2 and 11, generally blesses the native with a good family and satisfactory bank position. Mars, ruling the 3rd and 10th houses, gives the inclination to study, do research, be bold and courageous, and eventually attain name, fame, and reputation through ultimate success. Venus, ruling the houses 4 and 9, shows attachment to both parents, higher education, and research overseas. They will enjoy the fruits of life in this world. As Jupiter rules 2 and 11 and Venus governs 4 and 9, and because Poorvashada is governed by Venus in Jupiter's sign, people born in Aquarius are usually fortunate during the period of the planet occupying Poorvashada indicated by the occupant.  
Mercury ruling the 8th house and Moon the 6th house show that Aquarians have always food for thought and are often contemplating, planning, and scheming. If they are afflicted, they have a tendency to become melancholy and reclusive, and are strong pessimists.  

Characteristics to be Corrected

If either the ascendant or Saturn, the lord of ascendant, is afflicted by the adverse aspect from any planet, then:  
(a) The native will be lazy and lethargic, so they should cultivate activity and promptness;  
(b) They should avoid solitude;  
(c) They should not be worried and gloomy;  
(d) They should not be a pessimist;  
(e) They should not be pushy and alert;  
(f) They should not be very rigid towards those whom they dislike.  

Health

As Aquarius opposes the sign of the Sun, Aquarians are susceptible to infectious diseases. If one feels fatigue on little exertion, one should consult an intelligent and capable physician. Tooth trouble and tonsils may cause troubles, as Saturn is a cold planet and Aquarius is an airy sign, they will not have satisfactory circulation and cannot withstand cold weather. They should warm up their limbs and feet and attend immediately after any injury or abrasion. They should avoid living in malaria-infected areas and not overtax themselves. One should take rest when necessary. As Aquarius is the 11th sign of the zodiac, one's ankle or limb may be affected. One should guard against varicose veins and heart trouble, which may be rheumatic or cause high blood pressure. The legs may swell and Venus, if afflicted, can cause skin diseases, eczema, etc. One may also suffer from eye trouble, dropsy, and poor digestion due to sedentary life, constipation, and insomnia. Planets in Dhanishta threaten high fever, malaria, filaria, elephantiasis, and fractures, while planets in Sathabhisha and Poorvapathrapada can cause dropsy, irregularity of the circulatory system, elephantiasis, eczema, skin trouble due to poor circulation of the blood, ulcerated gums, and mottled enamel. Libra is the 9th sign to Aquarius, and Venus rules the 9th house. As Venus is a benefic by nature, it is considered to be evil as it affects one's longevity. Jupiter and Sun are the owners of the 2nd and 6th houses respectively, and Moon, as lord of the 6th house, causes disease during its period. The common ailment for Aquarians is indicated by Moon. Jupiter, Sun, Mercury (as lord of the 8th house), and Venus in their conjoined period or sub period can be fatal. According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, planets in Uthrapalguni, Visaka, and Poorvashada will affect the health of the native.

Finance and Fortune

Generally, Aquarians make money through modern machinery, inventions, and discoveries. They do not believe in earning money immediately for the work done. Instead, they may remain for a long period, patiently working and after finding out some developments and novel ones, they will make money by using their talent. They do not seek honor, but money, which they consider is needed for worldly life. They are neither economical nor liberal nor extravagant; they have the talent and ambition. They are both fortunate and unfortunate.  
Jupiter, which governs the second house, indicates that one can be a scientist, work in the administrative department of a large industry, or be the director of a public limited company, a lecturer, a metaphysician, psychologist, or astrologer, or work in legal, finance, education, or religious endowment boards. One may be a contractor of mine ores or deal in shipping and export.  
Moon, lord of the sixth house, indicates that one may practice medicine, do social service, shipping, be a sailor, submarine, pumpsets dealer, kerosene dealer, export and import businessman, or deal in any liquid.  
Mars, the lord of the tenth house, shows that one may deal in metals, insurance, chemicals, mechanical engineering, building construction, mine ores, be a brick kiln owner, boiler manufacturer, cement dealer, surveyor, surgeon who does post-mortem, murderer, butcher, barber, dealer in lead, copper, and steel, or be a C.I.D. officer.  
Mercury, forming a good aspect with the cusps of the second, sixth, or tenth house, produces booksellers, printers, accountants, registrars, interpreters, postmen, experts in handwriting and thumb-impression, C.I.D. inspectors, astronomers, astrologers, etc.  
Venus, forming a good aspect with the cusps of the second, sixth, or tenth house, shows that one may be a poet or painter or musician, deal in hats, shoes, purses, handbags, or chowries, be a barber or dealer in blades, deal in medicines for the cure of eczema, skin disease, or birth control, and sell goods for contraceptive practice. Very old stuff, especially wine, will be dealt with if Venus occupies the meridian. One will prosper as a social worker or an interior decorative artist.  
Uranus, forming a harmonious aspect with the cusps of the second, sixth, or tenth house or planets in these houses, indicates that one may be a research scholar or work in research institutes, or railways, public service, be a mechanic, technician in the electricity department, wireless stations, or electronics, a salesman, traveller, astrologer, engineer, or dealer in electrical goods.  
Neptune shows that one may work in a submarine, mine, secret service, intelligence department, be a fifth columnist, seaman, captain of a ship, salt dealer, etc.  

Domestic Environments

As Aquarians are very social, they keep their home clean and tidy so that they can entertain friends frequently. The home is usually well-furnished, often with a collection of antiques arranged in a modern fashion. Aquarians never hesitate to purchase ultra-modern electric appliances for the convenience of those at home. They take pleasure in possessing them, and even more pleasure in demonstrating them to visitors. They give up traditional and old cumbersome, troublesome methods, and instead adopt modern ones to save time and trouble. Aquarians are unique in that they prefer both solitude and company. They are also dutiful to their relatives, neither overly attached nor detached.  

Friends and Benefactors

Aquarius is the 11th sign of the Zodiac, and the 11th house to Aquarius is governed by Jupiter. Hence, Aquarians are always lively with good humour, high spirits, and cheer. They want many friends, and Jupiter gives them reliable, true, sincere, and good friends. With some of them, Aquarians may be somewhat reserved, which may lead these friends to think that Aquarians are unapproachable and cold. However, Aquarians do not find fault with others; they take everything in stride, even when they are not treated properly. Aquarians are good partners in business and harmonious husbands, contributing to a happy life. They have a great desire to study the character and behaviour of their friends. They are very true to their friends, even if a few of them may be selfish or cheats. They realise that too much intimacy will lead to contempt, so they are mostly quiet and unassuming, which helps them to gain a large number of friends and make home life pleasant.  

Romance and Marriage

As Aquarians are intelligent, they always prefer an educated and equally intelligent partner. As they have strong attachment and also a permanent one, and as they are unassuming, they do not have control over the partner. They move with all very freely, but they prefer those who are equally social, shrewd, and studious. Slowly and without assigning any reason, they will discontinue the friendship and love with one if the person does not meet the standards they expect. They do not give expression to their love. If the lovers are passionate, they will not be satisfied, as Aquarians may appear to be cold. This is a misunderstanding; Aquarians are not cold. Houses 2, 7, and 11 indicate a partner in life, and so the partners will be governed by Jupiter or the Sun. Therefore, the partners will be law-abiding, true, honest, and sincere. They are magnanimous and noble, and dutiful. Those marrying Aquarians will find that they are very human, kind, sympathetic, and accommodating. They are generous and gracious, and care for harmony and happiness. Aquarian wives are unconventional. If they find that the partners are not meeting their desired standards, they will not hesitate to satisfy themselves by changing partners. But, if the partner can satisfy them, they will cooperate most willingly with the husband, share their responsibilities, duties, and work, and even assist the husband in his work. Hence, Gemini and Libra-borns are best suited to Aquarians. The partners should know that the drawback of Aquarians in marriage is their impersonality. They may appear to lack interest to such wives who are selfish and who expect the husband to pay all attention to them and spend all the time with them. This is impossible for intelligent people who are always thinking and researching science, etc.  

Children

Aquarians do not act as if they are aged; they should be respected and behave like a strict teacher. As a result, children not only have the greatest affection for them, but also pay more respect to their parents. Aquarians train their children in intelligent and novel methods which contribute to their courage and confidence. They also narrate stories to their children to help them cope with childish ways, and encourage them to give their ideas and pursue their hobbies. Aquarians judge their children, telling them what is good and what is bad, and help them become versatile, active, and clever.
Houses 2, 5, and 11 denote children, and Jupiter and Mercury are the significators. This suggests that they will be journalists, information officers, mathematicians, propagandists, etc.

Lucky Days

Thursdays, Fridays, Tuesdays, and Mondays are the most fortunate days. Wednesdays and Sundays are unfortunate days, and Saturdays offer mixed results, mostly loss. It is best to speculate on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and compete with anyone on Tuesdays and Mondays. Fridays are best for entering a college or going overseas. Saturdays should be avoided for purchases and investments, and Wednesdays and Sundays should never be speculated on.

Lucky Colour

Yellow, red, white, and cream are lucky colours. Yellow indicates an increase in income, a satisfactory bank position, and a happy family life. Red indicates victory over enemies, reputation, and success. White indicates good domestic environments, pleasure, and success in education and dealing with foreigners. Cream indicates an overdraft facility, winning an election, and victory over enemies. Orange should be avoided, as it threatens opposition, and green should be avoided, as it indicates loss in litigation, trouble, and danger. Blue should also be avoided, as it indicates unexpected loss, treachery, etc.

Lucky Numbers

3, 12, 21, 30, 48, 57, and so on; 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54; 2, 11, 20, 38, 47, 56; 7, 16, 25, 34, 43, 52. Numbers to be avoided are 1, 10, 28, 37, 46, and 55; 4, 13, 22, 31, 40, and 58; 5, 14, 23, 32, 41, and 50; 8, 17, 26, 35, 44, and 53.

### Pisces - Meena
Pisces is the twelfth sign of the zodiac, the last sign of the zodiac. It is also 36 degrees in longitude. It extends from 330 degrees from the Vernal Equinox (the point of intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic where the zodiac commences - which is AMG to 360 degrees and this sign is at the end of the zodiac. The 30th degree of Pisces and the zero degree of Aries are one and the same point. As the Sun moves north, while passing through this sign, it comes nearer and nearer to the celestial equator and is exactly on the celestial equator when the Sun is in 30 Pisces.  
The constellations contained in the sign are Poorvapathra pada fourth quarter, Uthrapathrapada, and Revathi. According to the Sayana system, the Sun, nowadays, enters Pisces on or around 19th February and passes on to Aries on or around 21st March. The Sun moves by one degree and a half minute in the first week, mostly one degree until 7th March, and then it moves a little less than a degree a day. In the horoscopes erected according to the Sayana system, for people born in any of these dates, the Sun will be shown in Pisces. However, the Nirayana zodiac being a fixed one throughout this yuga, the Sun will enter Pisces-Meena on 12th March and leave this sign on 13th April any year. All the 21/4 stars in this sign will be passed by the Sun in this period. For people born during this time of year, the Sun will be shown in Pisces.  
Pisces is governed by Jupiter. Before the discovery of the planet Neptune, Westerners also allotted this sign to Jupiter. Now, they have given it to Neptune, as the qualities of this sign and those of Neptune mostly agree. In this sign, Venus is exalted, Mercury is debilitated, and Saturn does not lose strength but becomes auspicious.  
It is said by the Hindus that Venus and Jupiter are enemies. By that, they mean that the qualities of Jupiterians and Venusians will be different; their thoughts, their actions, their mode of life, their company, and society will never agree. We should not literally take that Jupiter and Venus are enemies. Jupiterians are inclined towards spiritual life whereas Venusians are out to satisfy their animal instincts and will try to enjoy all the fruits of life in this world.  
This sign is said to be a friendly one to the Sun, Moon, and Mars. To me, it appears that Moon alone can have full advantage in this sign and Mars as well as the Sun cannot be so strong in offering the results of the houses they own. Why? Pisces is the ninth sign to Cancer owned by the Moon. So, the Moon will form a trine aspect to its sign. But Mars will be weak in bestowing the results denoted by Aries, as it will be in the twelfth house to Aries, and the Sun loses strength to offer the matters signified by Leo, as the owner will be in the eighth house to its own house.  
Neptune, the God of the Ocean, will be strong in this sign. As Pisces is the twelfth sign of the zodiac and since the twelfth house denotes sea voyage and life in a foreign land, it is appropriate to allot this house to Neptune.  
Pisces is symbolized with two fishes. One will lead towards the north and the other towards the south and it is parallel to the ecliptic. This is called the sign of Moksha, Heaven, obtained by doing Dharma, i.e., one's duty, charity, etc. It is said that Jesus fed with five loaves and two fishes. This sign is a symbol of compassion also.  
Pisces is a watery, cold, common, Ubaya, feminine, fruitful, psychic, emotional, bicorporal double-legged sign on the Southern hemisphere and is of short ascension.  

Physical Features

Pisces generally produces short people. They will weigh as much as a tall person as they will be plump and the hands and feet will appear to be short and stout. The shoulders are muscular and spherical. The eyes will be big and protruding. But the hair will be soft and silky.  

Characteristics

Pisces is a watery sign ruled by Jupiter, the chief governor for philosophy and progeny. Hence, the person will be philosophical, restless, ever dreamy, contemplating, imagining, and never hesitating to lead a romantic life. He will be honest, outspoken, helpful, and humane. He will not go into the cause of other's troubles, but he will lead his assistance at moment's call. Just like water which can put out the fire (no doubt depending on the proportion also), the person born in Pisces will calm down the enemies, treat them courteously, and forgive them. He will be unassuming and due to over-liberality and unbounded generosity, he cannot progress much. They hamper his advancement. He is a staunch "Ahimsa" observer. He cannot think of doing harm to any; not that he is incapable; but he is so good a person depositing, in his bank, more of his meritorious deeds than the money which he can save by being economical. As it is a dual sign, he is a puzzle to others and to himself. One can find contradictions in his nature. He cannot be steady. He is mostly sweet-tempered and socially inclined.  
Being a feminine sign, he can be led away by fresh ideas and fancies. He will be polite and modest. Venus, exalted herein, makes him a poet, a musician, or a painter, or he can serve in a make-up room as he is a harmless person. So also, in worldly affairs, he can clearly understand the defects, difficulties, and deficiency and plan in various ways to alleviate the sufferings of the people. He is best fitted to be in the Planning Commission.  
Being a common and feminine sign, the expression of his thoughts will be modified and even thoroughly changed depending upon the audience. Pisces type of character is really difficult to cope with.  
Being the twelfth sign of the zodiac, he will have the desire to study the occult science, the divine life. He is timid and has no self-confidence. He will have the wish to go overseas and will be visiting foreign lands. Mars, the lord of the second house, makes him extravagant. He earns more and spends much more money. He will be frank and fearless. Venus as lord of the third house gives him good neighbours and he develops his friendship by his generosity and great service to them. Mercury indicates that he will be studious and be ever changing his residence. The Moon makes him more timid, dreamy, and imaginative. The Sun shows that he has to necessarily take all precautionary measures whenever there is an epidemic and he will be a nervous type of person.  
The one defect in Pisces is that they will rely upon all their friends and late in life they will realize that the world has produced both good and wicked people and he is also not an exception to fall a victim in the hands of the so-called Saturn and friends. Wisdom comes late.  

Characteristics to be Corrected

(a) Do not worry, as you are prone to changing moods.  
(b) Do not underestimate yourself.  
(c) Cultivate ambition.  
(d) Be generous, but not overly generous.  
(e) Do not rely on other people's promises.  
(f) Do not spend too much time daydreaming.  

Health

Being a watery sign, those born under Pisces will be prone to drinking and, as this sign is opposite to Virgo, they may develop gastric troubles. As the 12th house denotes the ankles and feet, they may suffer from affections of the ankles and feet, such as varicose veins or guinea worm.  
Sun in Pisces: Those born under this sign may experience perspiration of the feet, chillness, intestinal troubles due to lack of blood supply, and typhoid.  
Moon: Drinking and over-drugging the system.  
Mars: Fractures in the foot, deformities, corns, plies, inflammation in the bowels, and hernia.  
Mercury: Generous nervous debility, deafness, a tendency towards tuberculosis, and cramps.  
Jupiter: Swollen feet, perspiring, an enlarged liver, tumours in the abdomen and intestines, being overworked, deficiency of enzymes, and tumours in the abdominal region.  
Venus: Gout, intestinal tumours.  
Saturn: Rheumatism, foot-drop, tuberculosis, dropsy, and ben-ben.  
Planets in Poorvapadrapada constellation may cause abdominal tumours, an enlarged liver, and enzyme deficiency. Planets in Revathi star may cause deafness, general nervous debility, and cramps.  

Finance and Fortune

Pisceans are particularly happy when their vocation includes work that requires a broad vision and scope for good action. Their main mode of life and desire is to be of help to others who need either health or wealth knowledge. Therefore, they are good nurses, caterers, welfare workers, teachers, accountants, and bankers.
Since the fifth house - the house of pleasurable pursuits - is ruled by the Moon, who by nature gives such a hobby or desire according to the house it owns, one will be interested in music, opera, cinema, etc., and also occult science. The exaltation of Venus produces musicians, poets, actors, etc. They cannot concentrate and do any detailed work, but if any arduous task is to be done, they are methodical, persevering, industrious, true, sincere, and honest.  
They have good business ability and thrive better as a liaison officer than as a managing director or chairman. Jupiter owning both the ascendant and the tenth house shows that they can succeed as ministers and physicians. The best business or service suited to them will be sailor in the navy, captain of a ship, shipping and clearing agents in the harbour, port trust, custom house, dealers in drinks, oils, beverages, chemicals, motion pictures (since it is a mute sign), costumes, cosmetics, service in temples, churches, mutts, aquariums, submarines, isolation hospitals, asylums, sanatoriums, etc. Fishery, educational, shipping, financial, and medical departments are shown.  
People do not relish the idea of being dependent on their children in their old age. One need not elaborate the danger of being dependent. So, they want to invest (being the twelfth sign of the zodiac owned by a benefic) so that the money is safe and is useful as they are ever conscious of approaching old age. They will be helpful to others as they cannot refuse any request. Yet, they lend to those who can repay on demand. In spite of that, Saturn, as lord of eleven and twelve, threatens that a few friends - Saturnians - will be good friends until they receive the help and then disappoint the Pisces born. Never take a Saturnian as your private secretary as he will, on a later date, when you enter into a Saturn sub period, cause you anxiety and loss of prestige, honour, and money. Who are Saturnians? Those who are born either on Saturdays or in Capricorn or Aquarius as ascendant or in the star Pushyam, Anuradha, and Uthrapathrapada stars. Be doubly careful with them.  
The Sun forming a good aspect (as lord of six) shows permanent service in government departments. Mars, when favourable and strong, makes them serve in the navy, custom, port trust, and oil fields. They have plurality of interest. Jupiter as lord of ten makes one a politician or philosopher or serve in any of the departments indicated by Jupiter and, if allowed, to be in business also.  

Domestic Environments

People born under the sign of Pisces generally welcome many friends into their homes. They do not do this to entertain them, but rather because their guests will patiently listen to the narration of the troubles of Pisces-borns, pity them, and give them mental solace. They may even invite astrologers, as the 7th house is ruled by Mercury for astrologers.    
Pisces-borns are desirous of giving their children higher education, and they would also wish to have an educated partner in life. If their partner is not educated, they will try to educate them. They love a happy domestic life and are very affectionate at home. Throughout their married life, they strive to keep the romantic legend of lovers alive. One defect, as it appears to many, is that they are easily tempted by pretty faces and their fancies will wander. Many Pisces-borns are drawn to sculptures of different figures in temples, and they will stand for some time near cloth shops where they have kept figures of both sexes. This is due to the Moon, the lord of the 5th house, as every figure is a thrill for them and supplies them with enough food for imagination alone.  

Friends and Benefactors

As Pisces-borns are good by nature, kind by disposition, and very helpful, they will have many friends. Further, they have personal magnetism which adds more friends. However, their friends will take advantage of the Pisces-borns' willingness to sacrifice, forget their personal problems, and attend to the needs of their friends. Being a watery sign, belonging to benevolent Jupiter, they are influenced by their surroundings and environments. They worry themselves when their friends are in difficulties, and they enjoy when their good friends have fortune.  
They are very sincere and true to their friends, but they should be aware that not all of their friends are true and loyal. Some are outwardly honest but inwardly scoundrels, cheats, low-born, ill-bred, selfish people with a narrow mind. Therefore, Pisces-borns should not confide everything to their friends, as they may be betrayed and put into trouble by such few friends.  

Romance and Marriage

Pisces people prefer the beauty, intellectual pursuits, and fine arts of their partner. They do not want mean-minded partners, but they forget that such qualifications of the partner can lead to jealousy and suspicion, which can slowly kill their love. The partner should understand this suspicious nature of the Pisces-borns and try to assure them of their sincere love, and flatter them to their satisfaction. Pisces-borns will be ever dreaming about love and they will be delaying and postponing doing anything to develop it. They should not select any partner who is free with all.  
If Mars, ruling the second house, is the strongest significator, the partner will be bold, brave, and independent. If the Pisces-borns ill-treat the Martian type of partner, there can be no harmony at all. If Venus and Saturn form an evil aspect, the married life will be short and may end in a divorce. If Mercury is the strongest significator, the partner will be very clever, like a faithful animal, and will keep silent when the master is angry and fondle when the master is jolly. So, the partners will be tactful and clever. If Saturn is the strongest ruling planet, the Pisces-borns have to be a little careful and correct themselves, or else the partner will share the joy of Pisces-borns and, like a rat in a sinking ship, desert them when they are in difficulties.  
Pisces-borns can lead a happy life with Virgo-borns and Cancer-borns.  

Children

Jupiter, the lord of Pisces, is exalted in the fifth sign, Cancer, and the fifth house indicates offspring. This is likely why Piscesians love and adore their children, who reciprocate in kind. They are like a mirror, and will always return the same coin. Pisces-borns should not be too strict with their children, or else they will reap the consequences. If their children have not scored sufficient marks or are playful, they should be well advised and never threatened, as they will teach their parents a lesson. The children will usually be intelligent and successful in their lives, and often turn out to be good artists.  
If Pisces-borns are not moody and suspicious, they can be good social workers and lead a very happy and harmonious married life. Mars, Moon, and Saturn rule the houses that indicate children, which are 2, 5, and 11. Therefore, they will likely be rich business people dealing in mine products, metals, boilers, oils, etc.  

Lucky days for Pisces-borns

are Thursdays, Tuesdays, and Sundays. Mondays and Saturdays should be avoided, as they can lead to loss. Wednesdays and Fridays are inauspicious for Pisces-borns, but beneficial for their partners or opponents. Thursdays are best for profession, reputation, etc., Tuesdays for finance, higher studies, and long journeys, and Sundays for competition and overdraft facility. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are auspicious for making purchases for the partner, but Saturdays should be avoided for disputes and agreements.

Lucky colours for Pisces-borns

are red and yellow, rose and orange, while blue, white, cream, and green are good for their partners. A coral mounted in a gold ring may be used with advantage. Lucky numbers are 1, 4, 3, and 9, while 8 should be avoided.

Objects and professions indicated by Pisces

include politicians, ministers, bank agents, travellers, tourists, advocates, professors, generous people, religious-minded people, arbitrators, very rich persons, rulers, valuable dhanyam, corns, rishis, those who are charitable, who do penance and sacrifice, pearls, conch-shell, lotus, fragrant or aquatic flowers, salt, perfumes, gems, business people, literates, journalists, accountants, auditors, bankers, electric thermal station, etc.

Places indicated by Pisces

include ponds, oceans, fisheries, fish canneries, backwaters, places inundated, damp and wet places, make-up soil, oil fields, oil tanks, temples, harbours, asylums, sanatoriums, places of segregation, isolation, jails, water-mills, old hermitages, wells, cisterns, etc.

Products indicated by Pisces

include fisheries, breweries, rubber, submarine, diving operations, shipping, navigation, and liquids.

## The Twelve Houses and Their Significance
All matters are distributed among the twelve houses and each house influences certain matters. One must judge a particular house or a few houses for any particular affair. What each house denotes is discussed below.
House is measured from cusp to cusp. Therefore, the Lagna Bhava or first house commences from the point that just rises in the east and extends up to the second cusp and the whole area is above the horizon. That which has risen just before birth and extends upwards in the eastern horizon is the twelfth Bhava.

### Lagnam The First Bhava
Lagnam: Adya (first); Kalpa Udhayam (ascending); Janma (birth); Seersea (head); Dhanus (physical body); Anga (limb); Deham (physical features); Varthamana (living or livelihood).

The First House, or what is commonly known as the Ascendant (Lagna), signifies the native, their general appearance, character and temperament. It shows their physical stature, colour, form and shape, and constitution in general. The Ascendant is always an important factor in the matter of health. Good aspects to the cuspal degree of the Ascendant portray good health, while bad aspects threaten ill health during the period of the planets throwing the bad aspect. It also indicates the native's vitality and vigor, their peculiar habit of thinking, their natural disposition and tendencies, the native's personality and struggle for life, their success or failure in attempts (1st, 10th and 11th houses), their fortune or misfortune, etc. One should examine the 1st, 3rd and 8th houses to ascertain the probable span of one's life. The Ascendant also describes the native's station in life, general candour (status), honour, dignity, prosperity and general well-being. One should guess from the first house whether one has the determination and courage to push forward and forge ahead. The Ascendant, according to Hindu sages, shows the native's residence abroad. Therefore one should examine this house before one predicts whether the native will live in their own place or will make fortune in a far-off place. 

In short, this house is the significator of any changes in the individual's life. Hence this is of supreme importance. All depend upon the occupant and aspects to the Ascendant.

The First House Governs the Head and Upper Part of the Face.

In Mundane Astrology, the Ascendant of a country signifies the people in the country, the general state of the locality, or the state for which the horoscope is cast.

In Horary Astrology, the First House may be said to symbolize the person asking the question.

Bhattothpala says in 'Prasnajnana' that longevity, age, birth, health, happiness, virtues, suffering, one's form and complexion should be investigated from the first house. Limbs (growth of the limbs), happiness, misery, hair, appropriating other's money (if Saturn and Mercury are in the Ascendant and afflicted by Jupiter, the individual will not hesitate to misappropriate), gambling on other's money or for others, skin, sleepiness (whether the native will be active or sleepy) - if Saturn is in the lagna, especially with malefics Kethu or Rahu, then the native will be lazy; if Mars and Mercury are there then he will be ever active. Kalidasa adds that tendency to insult other men, freedom from disease, perseverance in the breeding of cattle (lord of 6 in the lagna or connected with the lord of lagna), loss of decorum and blame from one's kinsmen are all to be predicted from the first house. The lagna indicates advantages, gains, and profit to the younger brother and his friends.

The Significance of the Ascendant

The name, fame, reputation, and patrimony of the mother are attributed to the Ascendant. Higher studies, long journeys, life in a hostel during studies, and connections with strangers and foreigners for the native's children (especially the first child) are judged from the Ascendant. Danger to the maternal uncle and the end of open inimical activity is to be read from the first house. The demise of the partner, wife, or husband, and the pleasurable pursuits and speculation of the father are also included. Short journeys, editing, publishing, and neighbours to the elder brother are pre-shadowed by the Ascendant.

Thus, each house signifies certain matters concerning the individual and the same house indicates various matters relating to the relatives of the native. A house may be fortunate to the native and at the same time it may be unlucky to a relative. The native may keep good health but visit the hospital to attend to an ailing relative and be worried because of the relative. house.

### The Second House Governs Second Marriage
This is so because the 2nd house is the 8th to the 7th representing the first wife and it is generally after the death of the first wife that one will go in for second marriage. Though marriage is largely the concern of the 7th house, the second house should also be referred to ascertain the time of marriage, description of partner, and the state of married life. The second house also represents (i) vision or the power of observation, (ii) the right eye (generally eye) (the 12th house is said to govern the left eye), (iii) memory, and (iv) imagination. The other parts of the physical body governed by the 2nd house are the nail, tongue, nose, teeth, cheeks, and chin. Evil planets in the second house cause mole or scar in that part of the body; mole is found from infancy, but scar is formed when the person runs the period of the planet afflicting the second house.
One has to investigate the second house to find out whether the native protects others and whether he gains or loses through those dependent on him. Also, whether he has good understanding or misunderstanding with family members. If benefic planets occupy the 2nd house, then the native will have good understanding with his family. If malefics are there, then he will have no easy time with them, whenever he runs the periods or sub-periods of the malefics. If the lord of 6 is in the 2nd house and afflicted, then estrangements with the maternal uncle or aunt will be common. The second house also concerns law suits, uses of ordinary or costly metal (the metal depending upon the planet), his or her trade and business according to the nature of the planets posited and profit or loss thereby, the native's ability to buy and sell, and faith in ancient culture and custom (if lord of 12 is in 2). This house suggests whether the person will be extravagant or economical. If Saturn is in the 2nd house he will be economical and slow in speech. If Mars were to be there, the native will be extravagant and outspoken in speech. If Jupiter were to occupy the second house, then one will earn through fair means and also spend rightly. Further, he will speak well. The 2nd house has to do with loans, money lent or money borrowed by a person, money employed in speculation, etc., money left with a guardian, trust, etc.
Being a marakasthana, the second house shows the death of the individual; the kind or type of death is influenced by the 8th house. The 3rd house indicates one's span of life. 12th to any house is the detrimental one to the house matters. Therefore, 12th to the 3rd house is the second. Hence, 2nd house is a marakasthana. The 8th house also signifies one's span of life. 12th to the 8th house is the 7th. Hence, 7th house is the other marakasthana. (Sthana means house; Maraka means death).
This house, along with the 5th house, has to be considered to find out whether one has the aptitude for music. If the 2nd house is an airy sign, then the native may turn out to be a vocalist. If Mars, Saturn, and Venus are connected with the 2nd house, he may take to tabla or mridangam and prove successful. If the 2nd house falls in any airy sign and of short ascension, he will take to flute. Lord Krishna plays on flute. Why? His star was Rohini in Taurus. Second house is Gemini, an airy sign of short ascension. Hence, he has flute. If of long ascension, he would do well to take to nayanam (nadaswaram). If the 2nd house happens to be a watery sign, then he may take to jaladarangam. Neptune shows stringed instruments.
In questions relating to affairs of nations, this house signifies national wealth, banking activities, and all matters concerning revenue.

In Horary Questions, the Second House Denotes the Money of the Querist, Their Loss or Gain in Speculations Relating to Business and Pecuniary Affairs or Any Question in Particular (First, Second, and Eleventh Houses); Also of Loans, Etc.

According to the Uttara Kalamritam, the Following Are to Be Guessed from the Second House: Belief in Sacred Tradition, Truth and Falsehood, Tongue, Eyes, Nails, Garment; Copper, Diamond, Gem, Pearl, Trade, Softness of Speech, Perfume (Incense), to Support Others, Effort in Acquisition of Wealth, Miserliness or Liberality, Clear Oratorical Ability, Gold, Good Silver, Corn, Cereals, Nose, Rules of Going, and a Close Dependent.

In Prasnajana, Bhattotpala Avers That One Should Look for Pearls, Ruby, Gems, Minerals, Wealth, Clothes, and Business from the Second House
While the second house shows gain to the native, it also indicates loss to the younger brother and changes in life in a foreign place. Malefics in the second house threaten loss to the native and imprisonment of the younger brother. The second house also includes gifts given by the younger brother to the native. Mother's gains and her elder brother are indicated by the second house, as it is the eleventh to the fourth; rank, position, profession, and success of children are judged from the occupants of the second Bhava and the aspects to the second house. Beneficial aspects give rise in its period, and malefics do harm in their periods if there are both harmonious and disharmonious aspects and if both benefics and malefics are present in the second house.

The Second House of the Native Shows a Long Journey of the Maternal Uncle, Danger to Partner or a Share of Profits to Partner, and the Common Disease of the Native's Father. The Elder Brother's Purchase of a House, Land, or Vehicle is Found from the Malefics Occupying the Second House.

### Third House
Dhairya (courage, firmness); Duschikya (bad thoughts); Uras (breast); Karna (ear), especially the right ear; Vikrama (prowess); Parakra ma; Bhratru (brother or sister); Virya (heroism) depending on the planet; Pourusham (mental strength).

This house rules one's mental inclination and ability, memory, and the inherent propensities of the mind and intellect. The third house indicates an inclination to study, and the ninth house stands for higher education, research, wisdom, and philosophical tendencies.

This Is the House of Courage, Firmness, Valour, Prowess, and Heroism
If the Lord of 10th or 6th House has a Connection with the 3rd House in any Manner, then the Native May Be a Soldier or an Army Officer Depending on Other Considerations. The 3rd House Is the Bhrathrusthana and Represents the Native's Younger Brother or Sister. Cousins, Kindred, Casual Acquaintance, and Neighbours Are Also Governed by This House. Being the Sahayasthana, One Should Refer to the 3rd House to Ascertain Whether the Native Has the Assistance of Others or Is Individually Working Hard.

The Third House also deals with short travel. If the Third House is well connected, one may undertake small inland journeys such as travel by cycle, bus, tram, land, railway, crossing rivers and lakes, and short air travel. The Ninth House has to be looked at for long journeys, journeys to far-off places, and sea or air journeys to long distances. All kinds of correspondence and letters, papers, writing, accounting, mathematics, news of transit, means of communication such as cycle, bus, train, rail, etc., post offices, letter boxes, telephone, telegraph, teleprint, television, telecommunication, radio reports, signal, airmail, etc. belong to this house. 
If the Third House or its lord has any connection whatsoever with Houses Two, Six, or Ten, one can take up agency and do commission business. He can also be a broker, representative, mediator, messenger, publicity officer, etc. If the Fourth House or its lord has any connection, then the native can engage himself as an estate broker. Since the Third House signifies books and publications (magazines), one can become an editor, newspaper reporter, news correspondent, information officer, journalist, etc. The Third House also governs change of residence (being in 12 to the Fourth House), restlessness, want of peace, all movement, transition and change, library, bookstore, bargain, signature signing contracts or agreements, rumours of all kinds, conveying of messages, carrying tales etc. Kethu in the Third House makes one a duplicate "Narada". The parts of the body ruled by the Third House are ears (especially right ear), hands, throat, shoulder blade, collar bone, arms, and the nervous system.

If, in a lady's chart, the lord of the third house, which is a natural benefic, is posited in the second house, the native may put on jewels on her ears, hands, and neck, which are ruled by the third house.

If Rahu or Kethu is conjoined with Mars or the lord of the sixth house, or if Rahu or Kethu is placed in the third house along with Mars, then ear disease may result. Generally, malefics occupying any house will affect the part of the body ruled by that house. If malefics occupy the third house, there may be a mole in the part of the body governed by the third house.

If the Lord of Ten is in Three, the native is likely to get employment. If they are a doctor, then they may deal in ear diseases (ENT Specialist).

In State Astrology, the Third House Shows Neighbouring Countries and Treaties with Them

It also rules over transportation, whether it be aerial, rail, postal, road, telegraph, radio, or telephone. This also represents libraries and public education generally.

In Uttara Kalamritam, it is mentioned that the third house denotes ears, battle, roadside place, confusion of the mind, causing sorrow, soldier, one's own relations (brothers and sisters), throat, eating unspoiled or pure food, partition of property, the part of the hand between the forefinger and the thumb (sacred to the Manes), female servant, journey in a small good vehicle, and one's own religious duty.

In the Jataka Parijatam, the revered author explains that the welfare of the younger brothers, such as enterprise, tone, ear, select ornaments, articles of apparel, steadiness, valour, strength, and edible roots and fruits, can be seen from the third house.

Prediction Based on Saturn and Mars in the 3rd House

When predicting how courageous someone will be, it is important to consider the position of Saturn and Mars in the 3rd house. If Saturn is in the 3rd house, the person will be cautious and will wait and see before taking any bold action. On the other hand, if Mars is in the 3rd house, the person will be very brave and will act on the spur of the moment. For example, if two people are standing on the bank of a river and they see a stranger who is not a swimmer fall into the river, the person with Saturn in the 3rd house will hesitate to help, as they will want to be sure of their own safety, whereas the person with Mars in the 3rd house will immediately plunge into the river to try and save the person who is about to be drowned.

Health of Younger Brother, Success or Failure, Loss or Investment by Mother, Gains to Children or Friends of Children, Rank and Position of Maternal Uncle, Long Journey or Higher Studies of Partner, Birth of Children to Elder Brother or Sister:

Judging from the 3rd House, it is a maraka house to father. In most horoscopes, Rahu in the 3rd house causes father's death during its period or sub period. Suppose one is running the period or sub period of the significator of the 3rd house. If the native's mother has suffered a loss and the native's child's friend has visited the place and their character is doubtful, then it is likely that this friend of the child is the culprit who caused the loss to the native's mother.

### Fourth House:
The fourth house corresponds to the feminine sign Cancer (Kataka) ruled by the Moon, which is identified by Hindus as Goddess Parvathi. Hindu sages have attributed the fourth house to the mother, while Westerners consider it to be the house for the father, which is not supported by wise Hindu astrologers. The fourth house relates to one's home, residence, domestic environments, and the general condition of the native in the later part of their life. This house is also called the 'grave', meaning that it is concerned with all hidden things such as private affairs, curious secrets, and secret life. If the beneficial Saturn were to occupy this house and receive good aspects from the lords of 2 and 11, one may hoard their savings. The fourth house also shows one's landed or immovable property, those holdings which one takes on lease or rent, and those rented or leased out to other people. It denotes whether one will have their own vehicles or enjoy others', and all permanent possessions such as fields, pastures, corn-fields, farms, orchards, mines, real estate, gardens, buildings, ancient dwellings, monuments, and antiquities are influenced by this house.



The fourth house should also be examined in connection with patrimony (all inheritance descending in a direct line, hereditary properties, and treasures hidden underground).

This House Has an Impact on Education and Qualifications of a Person
In this respect, the Fourth House may be taken to indicate school and collegiate education, in contrast to higher education and research, which is denoted by the Ninth House. The Third House relates to the mental inclination to study a particular subject.

The Fourth House Holds Significance to the Termination, Conclusion, and End of Every Undertaking, Whether in Nativity or Horary Astrology.

In State Astrology, the fourth house governs mines, gardens, public buildings, crops, agriculture and determines the outcome of any undertaking.

Kalidasa Says in Uttara Kalamritam: The Following Are to Be Guessed from the Fourth Bhava

Learning Vehicles Similar to Rickshaws, Small Boats and the Like, Mother, Oil Bath, Relations, Caste, Small Well, Water, Milk as Medicine or Great Supernatural Efficacy (Sun in 4 Well Aspected by Uranus), Trust, False Allegation, a Tent or Pavilion, Digging a Pond or Well and Their Installation for Public Use, Mansion Art, Entrance into a House, Conclusion, Disposition, Loss of One's Dwelling, Paternal Property, Celestial Food, the Art of Finding Out Where Stolen Property is Kept, Development of Vedic and Secret Texts, Cows, Buffaloes and Abundance of Corn, Gain, etc. Produced in Wet Lands

Bhattotpala is of the view that the fourth house has to do with great herbs, treasures, and entering holes or caves.

If the fourth house and Mars are favourable during their conjoined periods, one will buy land. If they are unfavourable, he may sell away or there could be a loss through the investment in land, buildings, etc.

If the fourth house and Venus are beneficial, one will possess a car or any other vehicle when they run the conjoined period of the significator of the fourth house and Venus, or any planet connected with Venus.

If there is an evil aspect, then during their period together one can incur heavy expenses due to the vehicle, have an accident, or sell the conveyance and suffer without the usual transport they enjoyed.

If the fourth house significator and Moon receive good aspects, he will have a long-living and helpful mother with a good understanding and relationship. If they are afflicted by adverse aspects, one may lose their mother or have an unfriendly relationship.

Fourth House Indicates Bank Position of Younger Brother, Health of Mother, Loss to Children (Children May Go to Another Place), Gains to Maternal Uncle, Inherited Property, Popularity, Prosperity, and Profession of Partner; Danger to Father as It Is the Eighth House to the Ninth, Open Enemies of Elder Brother, Since Fourth House Is the Sixth Counted from the Eleventh House; Twelfth House Indicates Secret Enemies. Their Speculative Activities, Their Children, Etc., Are Also Shown by the Fourth House. The significations of the fifth house are Rajanta (sovereign's mark), Kara (tax or toll), Buddhi (intellect), Tanaya (children), Putra (son), Jatara (belly), Sruti (Vedic knowledge), Smriti (traditional law), and Poorvapunya (virtuous act previously done).

### The Fifth House 
The Fifth House Presides Over Pleasure, Society, and Social Inclinations

The fifth house presides over pleasure, society, and social inclinations. It deals with tastes and fancies, artistic talents, and property derived through a wife or business partner's luck. This house denotes the type of recreation, entertainment, amusements, sports, romance, and similar interests that appeal to a person. It is connected with all material and physical pleasures, such as games, sports, cinema, opera, drama, music, dance, banquets, merriment, and amusements of all sorts. It also indicates places of entertainment.

The Fifth House: A Trine House Indicating 'Poorva Punya Sthana'

The fifth house is a trine house, indicating 'poorva punya sthana', which shows what meritorious deeds one could have done in the previous birth. It is also concerned with speculative affairs and all matters of enterprise prompted by the desire nature. All games of chance, such as cards, crossword puzzles, dice, horse racing, shares, lotteries, gambling, betting, and stock exchange, come under the domain of the fifth house.

The Native's Love Affairs

The degree of success or failure achieved in love affairs, courtship, and licentiousness, the legitimate and illegitimate attraction and social intercourse between the sexes prior to wedlock and after marriage come under this house; also, kidnap, rape, and other such matters. It may be said to represent the seat of the physical and magnetic attractions between the opposite sexes.

In Questions Relating to National Affairs, the Fifth House Indicates Envoys, Ambassadors, Banquets, Etc.

According to Uttara Kalamritam, the following also have to be determined from the 5th house: good morals, mechanical art, discretion (weighing the merits and demerits of a thing), discrimination between virtue and sin, prayer by incantations, chanting of Vedic hymns, religious-mindedness, deep pondering, profound learning and wisdom, enormous riches, hereditary post, festive occasions, intense satisfaction, a long literary production, an umbrella, a great desirable action, paternal property, liaisons with courtesans, and the gift of cooked rice.

The author of Jataka Parijatham makes it clear that a person's tutelary deity, intelligence, son, religious merit, and ruler or sovereign are to be ascertained from the 5th house. According to him, pilgrimage has to be predicted taking the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 11th bhavas into account, with visits to far-off places being found out with reference to the 12th bhava. Malefics in the second house show separation from family, which may include a journey. The 5th house connected with malefics will bring in separation from children, while benefics in the 5th indicate visits to holy places to fulfill one's vow. The 10th house shows pilgrimage to holy places or journeys on duty.

Fifth House Shows That One Will Be Inclined to Take Risks and Speculate. One May Speculate; Their Gains or Losses Are Shown by the Planet with Which the Lord of the Fifth House Is Conjoined or Aspected. Additionally, Bad Aspects to the Fifth House Cusp from the Lord of the Fifth, Eighth, or Twelfth Houses Show Gains in Speculation. (This Is My Unfailing Finding; Research Students Can Verify.)

Fifth House Indicates Short Journeys, Publications of the Next Younger Brother, Mother's Bank Position, One's Own Child's or the Second Younger Brother's (Younger to the Next Younger Brother) Health, Success or Failure, Their Characteristics, Fortune etc., Changes in Maternal Uncle's Position, His Loss or Hospitalisation of Pet Animals, Sixth House Indicates Pet Animals, and Twelfth House Shows Hospitalisation (Fifth House is the Twelfth to the Sixth).

Gains to Partner, Profit to Opponent, Friends of Partner, Father's Father, Long Journey Made by Father, Higher Academic Qualification, Contacts with Strangers and Foreigners, Marriage to Elder Brother or Sister, Elder Brother's Partner in Business or Maraka (Death)

The Sixth House: The House of Sickness
The sixth house is known as the house of sickness. It indicates disease and sickness, the real state of the disease, recovery from it, and whether it is of a long or short duration. The sixth house is concerned with disease, the twelfth house with hospitalization, and the eleventh house, which is twelve to the twelfth house and six to the sixth house, governs discharge from hospital. This is an important house for those who have to do with nursing and treatment of the sick. It is also related to food and dietary habits, and all health is often due to improper care of the body and inattention to the diet most suited.

Mercury in the Sixth House Shows Fads and Fancies Regarding Diet

Saturn in this Position Indicates Under-Nourishment Generally

Mars Occupying the Sixth House Causes Over-Indulgence in Eating

Jupiter in the Sixth is Generally Good for Health Matters, but at Times it Denotes Ill-Health Through Love Feasting

Moon Denotes That the Native Will be Whimsical and Fanciful in the Matter of Eating and Over Fond of Liquids and Spirits, Especially if the Sixth House Happens to Fall in a Watery Sign and it Has Connection with Mars

If Venus is in this Position, the Native Has a Taste for Nice Food and Drinks and May Endanger His Health Through Excess

One Should Not Predict Sickness Without Considering All Other Factors

It is generally accepted that malefics occupying any house can affect the part of the body ruled by that house, particularly if the house is the sixth. However, health will only break down during the periods or sub-periods of planets occupying the sixth house, or the stars of these occupants, or during the periods of planets in conjunction with the lord of the sixth house.

The Sixth House and Work

The sixth house is connected with work and the service rendered by the individual, as well as the exhaustion caused by it. It also denotes the individual's employees, subordinates, or servants, whether they are in the service of the individual or the individual has others as employees. The condition and faithfulness of the individual's inferiors can be ascertained from this house. If benefics are posited in the sixth house, the native may gain from their servants; if malefics are present, then the native may lose through their servants and incur expenses on them that outweigh their income.

The Seventh House and Transactions

The seventh house represents the person with whom the native transacts anything, such as a banker or one who lends or borrows. If the native raises a loan, then the seventh house indicates the banker or lender, and the sixth house, being twelve houses away from the seventh house, denotes that the lender's financial position deteriorates. The sixth house is therefore the house of debt or borrowing. The native will be successful in raising loans if benefics occupy the sixth house or if the sixth house or its lord is connected with benefics in any manner.

Other Connections

This house also governs pet animals and small cattle, domestic creatures, tenants (agricultural tenant or house tenant), enmity, dress and hygiene, sanitation, dietetics, herbs, food and clothing, and the six flavours. Since it is said to be an upachaya sthana, it indicates favourable results in competition or otherwise.

The Sixth House is Also the House of Phenomenal Magic and Superstition: Matters Likely to Bring Worry and Annoyance

According to Uttara Kalamritam, diseases, obstacles in any undertaking, maternal uncles, swellings in the body, insanity, boils, enmity, sickness, miserliness, debt, wounds, mental worry, and intense anguish, incessant eye trouble, receiving aims, untimely meals, trouble and fear from one's dayadins, exertion, service, a severe colic or gout, theft, calamity, prison houses, and cruel actions must also be studied with reference to the sixth house.

In Mundane Astrology, the Sixth House Rules the Working Class, Industries, Sanitation, and Public Health
Vaidyanatha Dikshitar has elucidated in his work "Jataka Parijatam" that diseases, enemies, bad habits, and hurts are to be guessed from the Sixth Bhava.

Sixth House: An Exhaustive Explanation

The sixth house is one that needs explanation, as in one sloka it is condemned as an evil house, whereas the same author takes it as a house that offers beneficial results when occupied by malefics, calling it an upachaya sthana. How to interpret it needs an exhaustive explanation.

The sixth house shows the purchase or sale of conveyance, building, etc. by a younger brother or sister, short journeys of the mother, the bank position and profession of the first issue and their family, loss to the partner or investment or purchases made by the partner, and the secret enemies of the partner or the partner's changes and life in a foreign place or disharmony with or separation from the partner.

If Present:
Indication of Name and Fame, Occupation, and Business of Father in a Chart

It is the house that indicates the name and fame, occupation, and business of the father. If the lords of the 6th and 10th houses form a good aspect and the lord of the 6th house is strong, the native has the same profession as the father.

"The Sixth House is the House of Danger to One's Elder Brother or Friend. Unless the Sixth House is Auspicious, Business People Cannot Have Satisfactory Assistance from the Bank, Customers, etc. For Overdraft Facilities, the Sixth House Must Receive Most Favourable Aspects."

### Seventh House: 
Saptama; Jamittra; Chittottha (Desire); Kama; Dvuna (Love); Madha (Passion); Gamana (Cohabitation); Astna (Setting); Advan (A Way or Road); Marga (Way); Loka (Public); Kalathra (Wife or Husband); Pathni; Pathi; Kalathrasampat (Dowry).

The Seventh House is the "House of Union or Earthy Ties". The Seventh House represents legal bondage. It is through this that one ought to divine about marriage. Although marriage is principally the concern of the Seventh House, it is necessary to consider Houses Two and Eleven also in this respect.

By marriage, it is meant that there is an addition to the family. The second household includes the father, mother, wife, and children, etc.

The Married Partner Brings Permanent Tie of Friendship for Progeny and Pleasure Influenced by the 11th House

Therefore, one has to examine not only the seventh house, but also the houses two and eleven. Houses two, seven, and eleven connected with benefic planets either by association or by aspect denote that the partner in life will come from a respectable family, will be virtuously disposed, and will possess good qualities to enable one to lead a happy and harmonious wedded life.

Besides the life partner, the Seventh House also refers to partners in trade or business and the degree of success achieved through such partnerships. It also indicates all those with whom the native enters into any contract or agreement, those with whom the native is engaged in quarrels and comes into conflict in the open through arguments, litigation, duels, etc., the native's competitor in any undertaking, their rival in any contest, such as in an election, and their public adversaries. In a nutshell, the Seventh House may be said to indicate all those with whom the native transacts or deals in any manner - the engineer or contractor who builds the house for the native or, if the native themselves is an engineer or contractor, the person for whom the native builds; the doctor attending on the native or the patient on whom the native attends if they happen to be a medical practitioner; the person who lends the native money or they who borrow from the native; and so on. Good aspects to the planet in the Seventh House or to the cusp of the Seventh House portray good relationships with the public and favour from them. During the period of the planet in evil aspect, one ought to be careful in undertaking any public activity. This house also denotes whether one will mix up freely in society.

Fines, divorces, legal bonds, agreements, contracts, etc., are other matters ruled by the Seventh House. The Seventh House shows breaks in journeys. The Third House signifies short journeys, and the Ninth House denotes long journeys. The Seventh House indicates visits to various places in one trip.

The Influence of One in Foreign Countries and the Honor and Reputation Achieved There Depends on the Planet in the Seventh House and the Aspect It Receives

Longevity and the Maraka Houses
The first house denotes longevity while the seventh house opposes and is a maraka house, i.e., a danger to longevity. Houses eight, three, and one influence longevity and one has to examine these three houses to determine whether one will be long-lived, or will live up to the middle age, or only up to the adult age, or die in infancy. The twelfth house to any bhava is said to be the negation of that particular bhava, that is to say, it spoils the matters signified by that bhava. Therefore, the houses seven, two, and twelve, which are respectively in twelfth to houses eight, three, and one, prove inimical to longevity and are so termed 'marakasthanas'.

In Prasna or Horary Astrology, this house answers queries relating to the recovery of lost property, describing the thief, pickpockets, etc. The Lagna represents the owner of the stolen property. The fourth Bhava denotes the place of the stolen article. The seventh Bhava shows the thief. The eighth Bhava, being two to the seventh, indicates the thief's wealth. Therefore, when the planet in the seventh or the lord of the seventh is eclipsed or weak, the thief will be caught.

The Lagna Represents One's Routine Life and Permanent Place of Residence; The Seventh House, Opposite to It, Shows Change of Residence. One Should Also Consider the Third House for Change of Residence.

In Mundane or Political Astrology, the Seventh House is considered in matters pertaining to international relationships and arbitration, war and foreign affairs, international trade, the general condition of women, and laws relating to marriage and divorce, public reaction to national policies, public meetings, etc. Westerners call this the House of Open Warfare and Enmity, as well as of Treaties and Alliances.

The Seventh House and Younger Siblings
The seventh house is also regarded as dealing with the native's third brother or sister. The third house from the lagna indicates the first younger brother or sister; the house which is the third to the third shows the second younger brother; the seventh house, which is the third to the fifth house, represents the third younger brother or sister. It is also the house of self-acquisition of the native's servant or employee, being the second house counted from the sixth representing servants. Because the fifth house shows the first child or conception, the seventh, which is the third to the fifth, represents the first child's younger brother or sister or the native's second child; the ninth denotes the third child and so on in this manner.

Being in the fourth house, which indicates the mother, the seventh house deals with the mother's immovable property, vehicle, etc. According to Uttara Kalamritam, the seventh house rules the adopted child. This is understandable, as someone who is issueless may take their younger brother's child in adoption, which is not uncommon.

The Seventh House also denotes the danger of a secret enemy, difficulties, death, etc., being in the Eighth House to the Twelfth House; the religion, long journeys, and higher education of friends or elder brother being the Ninth House reckoned from the Eleventh House; the honour and credit of the Government being in the Tenth House to the Tenth House; associates and friends of the father being the Eleventh House to the Ninth House.

The Native Might Enter into a Partnership with His Father's Friend.

### Eighth House:
Mangalyasthana: Ashta (eight), Ayus (life, longevity), Adhi (mental pain), Parabhava (defeat or insult), Klesha (sorrow), Apavadha (scandal, ill-repute), Marana (death), Asuchi (impurity), Vinga (obstacle, impediment).

The Eighth House and Longevity
The Eighth House is considered to have a direct bearing upon one's longevity or span of life in this world. In considering the question of longevity, it is necessary to take into account the First and Third Houses as well as the Eighth House.

The Eighth House: The House of Death

The eighth house is also called the "house of death" - after having lived the allotted span of life - and all that is related to death such as inheritance, legacies, wills, insurance, gratuity, bonus, etc. The lagna indicates incarnation; the eighth, disincarnation. Hindus consider the eighth house as the end of man's life in this world. marana-sthanas and the lords of the 8th and 3rd houses.

This house conveys whether death is natural or unnatural (e.g. by drowning, fire, accident, or suicide) or due to chronic diseases, and whether it is slow or sudden and violent. The time of death can be inferred with reference to houses 7 and 2, which are 12th and 3rd houses respectively, after judging the bhadaka-sthanas, marana-sthanas, and the lords of the 8th and 3rd houses.

The Effects of the Eighth House on Life

First of all, it should be seen whether the horoscope promises a short, medium, or long life. If the horoscope shows a long life, an evil aspect formed to the 8th house or the planets connected with it by progression or by transit when the native is in his youth will not bring about death. It may cause ill-health, but when the period or sub-period of a beneficial planet showing vitality and immunity follows, the native will fully recover. The 8th house may also denote other disturbing events, such as worry due to a father's hospitalization. The 8th house is the 12th to the 9th house, which represents the father.

When the 8th house is occupied by the lord of the lagna, or the planet in the 8th house is posited in the constellation of the lord of the lagna, or the lord of the 8th house is in conjunction with the lord of the lagna, the indication is that the native himself will be the cause of his own death. If the lord of the 3rd house, occupying the 8th house, is in the constellation of the lord of the 12th house, the native's younger brother or sister may be the cause of death to the native. If the 3rd house alone is connected, the death may happen during travel in a nearby locality. If the 12th house is connected, the death may take place in a nursing home, asylum, sanatorium, or in an unknown place. If the 11th house is connected, one may die in a friend's or elder brother's residence. If the 9th house is in any way connected, it is likely that the native may die in a far-off place or while going on a long journey.

Uranus Connected with the 8th House May Indicate Strange and Sudden Death, Death Caused by Explosion, Death Due to Incurable Diseases, and More. The Disease May Defy Diagnosis and the Native May Die Due to Wrong Treatment. Electrocution and Death by Lightning and Electric Shock Are Also Portended.

Neptune Indicates a Mysterious Death
Death may occur after being in a state of coma or unconsciousness, or due to an overdose of drugs or allergy, etc. Death may also be caused by gas, drowning, poison, etc. If the 8th house falls in a watery sign, death may happen by drowning.

Saturn Gives Liability to Death Due to Colds, Rheumatism, Bone Troubles, and Chronic Diseases, Denoting a Slow and Lingering Death

Jupiter generally gives a peaceful and natural death, but if afflicted by evil aspects from other planets, then death may be due to blood poisoning, cancer, liver trouble, or inflammation of the lungs.

Mars Causes Death Due to Shocks, Accidents, Fire, Epidemics, and Inflammations

Death may occur after a short and sudden attack of illness. If Mars is in a fiery sign at birth and is the significator of death, then the death may be caused by fire, violence, or mechanical instruments. If it is in a watery sign, then the native may drown and die. If Mars is posited in an airy sign, then haemorrhage may be the cause of death.

The Author of Sanketanidhi Calls the Eighth House the House of Mystery and Misery
It has to do with misfortune and mental anxiety, sorrow and strife, worries and privations, delay and dejection, disappointment and defeat, loss and obstruction, blame and ill-repute, accidents, danger from enemies, danger due to diseases, and fear. Impediments and imprisonment, quarrels and fights, and wrong actions also come under the domain of this house. According to Ramadayalu, crossing a river, theft, robbery, siege of a fort, and fighting also come under the domain of this house.

The Financial Status of the Business or Life Partner

The share of profit accruing to the native through the business partner or the dowry or other income derived through a wife or husband is shown by the 8th house. Despite being one of the dushthanas, our wise sages have stated that no house is really evil. Benefics occupying any house improve the matters influenced by that house, while malefics in any house cause destruction to the affairs signified by the bhava occupied. Mahadeva in Jataka Thatva has stated that benefics in the 8th house indicate gain to the partner, meaning that the native may benefit by linking their fortune with another.

The Second House Governs the Native's Self-Acquisition

The Eighth House is Related to the Native's Unearned Wealth or Share of Profit

The Eighth House Also Denotes Surgeons, Medical Officers, Health Inspectors, Slaughter Houses, Butchers, Coroners, and So On

Jupiter or Saturn, the Two Philosophical Planets Occupying the Eighth House, Arouse in the Native a Deep Interest for Occultism and Mystical Subjects

Mercury, the Planet of Pure Intellect in This Position, Denotes an Enquiring Mind Concerning Occult Matters, and One May Be Inclined to Study Hidden and Metaphysical Problems.

In Questions Relating to Nation, the Eighth House Deals with Public Mortality, the Death Rate, Suicide, Serious Accidents, Infection, Flood, Fire, Famine, Disease, Earthquake, National Calamity or Gv:ef, Financial Relations with Foreign Countries, the Nation's Exports and Imports, Debts Due from Foreign Countries, Surrender or Loss of Territory to Another Country, Public Loans, Debts and Interest Rates, Deficit Budget, Estate Duties, and Public Sales.

In Horary Astrology, This House Must Be Referred To for Information Relating to Crossing of Rivers, Difficulties of Journey, Impenetrable Sufferings Caused by Enemies, Death, Corruption, Fight, Disease, and Vulnerable or Weak Points (Prasnagnana).

The Fourth House, according to Uttara Kalamritam, rules over hereditary property. The Fourth House is the Eighth House to the Ninth, denoting the father. Normally, the father's ancestral or unearned property passes on to the son after the father's death. Additionally, the Eighth House is the Twelfth House to the Ninth House. The father may make investments which, after his death, accrue to the native.
It is the Fifth House to the Fourth, indicating the mother. The mother may gain through lottery, prize bond, or speculation if benefics are in the Eighth House. The ninth house is also known as the house of 'Acharva' (guru or preceptor) and 'Pithru' (father). It is also associated with 'Subham' (auspiciousness), 'Pooja' (worship), 'Tapas' (penance), 'Dharma' (virtue), 'Pauthra' (grandson), 'Japa' (prayer) and 'Daiva Upasana' (spiritual inflation). It is also associated with 'Arya Vamsa' (noble family).

### Ninth House
The ninth house is associated with faith, wisdom, and divine worship. It is considered to be an auspicious house, as it shows one's fortune in the present life as a result of past actions. Luck being closely linked to merit, one will only reap the fruits of the acts done in the previous birth. Therefore, a look at the ninth house would enable one to know what 'bhagya' (fortune and prosperity) one has accumulated as a result of the meritorious deeds done in the previous birth. The ninth house is also known as the house of 'Acharva' (guru or preceptor) and 'Pithru' (father). It is associated with 'Subham' (auspiciousness), 'Pooja' (worship), 'Tapas' (penance), 'Dharma' (virtue), 'Pauthra' (grandson), 'Japa' (prayer) and 'Daiva Upasana' (spiritual inflation). It is also associated with 'Arya Vamsa' (noble family).

Since the Ninth House Rules Philosophy, Religious and Philosophical Beliefs

If Jupiter, the philosophical planet, is in the Ninth House and well-aspected, the native may be religious, devoted, orthodox, and kind-hearted. Even Saturn in this position receiving favourable aspects makes one deeply religious, methodical, and meditative. Jupiter or Saturn receiving good aspects from the Sun or Mercury gives one intuition and forethought. He will be much esteemed in religious circles and will occupy coveted positions in religious and philanthropic institutions. However, if these planets are adversely aspected, one is liable to go to extremes in religious and other matters.

All matters concerning temples, churches, mosques, and other religious institutions, including those devoted to promoting people's spiritual welfare, should be ascertained from this house. Hindus attribute pilgrimage to holy places, wells, circular reservoirs, sacrifices, and charity to the 9th house.

The Third House is the House of Perception and Learning, while the Ninth House is the House of Intuition and Pure Reason. If the Third House is concerned with ordinary mental inclinations, the Ninth House is concerned with higher education, higher knowledge, and higher thought. The degree of knowledge one may develop - whether collegiate, academic, philosophical, religious, literary, artistic, or scientific - can be deduced from this House. The Ninth House presides over research, invention, discovery, exploration, and submission of theses. religion, long journeys, higher education, philosophy, etc.

Hindus attribute the 9th house to the father because the ninth sign of the zodiac, Dhanus (Sagittarius), is ruled by 'Guru' the Preceptor and spiritual teacher. In ancient times, the father was invariably the spiritual preceptor or guru of the children to whom he would initiate Brahma Upadesam and transmit his siddhis or psychic powers. Counting the 9th house as the first, we find that the fifth therefrom indicates the native. Some persons advocate the fourth house and the tenth house for the father, but this is incorrect. Always take the 9th house for the father. To this house is ascribed law, legal arbitration, religion, long journeys, higher education, philosophy, etc.

Spiritual Initiation, Teaching, and Everything Connected to It

Probably because the ninth sign of the zodiac is owned by the wise Jupiter, Hindus term the ninth as the house of dharma or virtue and of an occult and metaphysical mind. Dreams and visions come under the purview of this house, as well as communications with spirits and the like. Neptune, the planet of dreams, in the ninth denotes peculiar dreams.

The Third and Ninth Houses Indicate Change or Journey Away from Permanent Residence
The Third House denotes short travels; the Ninth, representing the wider mind, is related to long journeys, sea voyages, air travel, etc. It determines the amount of travel in far-off places or countries and the success achieved there. Strangers and foreigners, as well as their relations, come under the influence of this house.

The Ninth House Governs Publishing

The ninth house governs publishing, especially volumes of intrinsic value, particularly those relating to religion, science, law, philosophy, travel, and international affairs. This is in contrast to the third house, which relates to lighter reading, news, and matters of ephemeral nature. To gain insight into one's success in such matters, one should examine the ninth house. Yuga, the ninth house was the abode of Dharma.

Association with good people, reverence and devotion to God and elders, the medicine most constitutionally suited, previous birth and punya, and the blessings received from the family deity should be divined from this house. Providential help is due to the occupation of benefic planets in the ninth bhava, or because the ninth lord is favourably placed. In Satya Yuga, the ninth house was the abode of Dharma.

Samhita, the author, says that matters relating to rest houses and favours from others should be investigated from the Ninth House in State Astrology. The Ninth House relates to all forms of long distance travel and communications, such as sea voyages, air and land travel, legal departments, judges, matters relating to religion, temples, churches, religious and philosophical thought in the nation, science, text-book publishing, universities and those connected with them, emigration and immigration, import and export of the nation, national trade and commerce, short-wave radio and long distance communications, cables and wireless.

Kalidasa states that one should judge the following matters from the Ninth House: charity, virtue, visits to holy places, association with good people, Vedic sacrifice, good conduct, purity of mind, reverence to elders, penance, medicinal drugs, one's policy, God worship, acquisition of higher learning, dignity, mythology, moral study, long travel, ancestral property, horses, elephants and buffaloes (connected with religious purposes), coronation hall and circulation of money.

Bhattotpala in Prasnagnana states that wells, lakes, tanks, water-sheds, temples, monetary vows, pilgrimage and meritorious deeds should be judged with reference to the Ninth House.

The Ninth House governs short travels of the wife or husband of the business partner, which is the third reckoned from the Seventh House; the servant's vehicle and landed property, which is the fourth from the Sixth House; the child's speculative benefits and pleasures, which is the fifth to the Fifth House; the mother's illness, her servants, etc., which is the sixth to the Fourth House; the younger brother's wife or the younger sister's husband or their competitors, rivals, etc., which is the seventh counted from the Third House. It is the house of friends to the elder brother and indicates the elder brother's accomplishments, which is the ninth to the Tenth House.

### Tenth House:
The applications applied to the 10th bhava are: Madhya; Meshurana; Jeevana (livelihood); Rajaspadada (kingdom); Sat (good); Kriya (work); Vyapara (commerce, trade, business); Jaya (success); ASpada (rank or position); Achara (good conduct); Mana (honour); Kriyam (sacrifice); Agya; Ajna (command); Guna (quality); Artha (wealth); Gamana (gait); Gnana (wisdom); Pravrithi (inclination); Karma (occupation).

The Midheaven, or angle of the south, whose line or cusp the Sun touches at midday at every place on the Earth, is termed the Medium Coeli or the 10th house. Hence, it is the chief or supreme angle of the heavens. In astronomical calculations, the 10th house is a principal feature, as all arcs of directions to the angles are measured from the Right Ascension of the Midheaven. In astrological predictions, it is the most important, being related to all matters affecting one's name, fame, honour, and recognition.

Both Western and Hindu astrologers agree that planets are very powerful when they occupy any of the houses 1, 4, 7, or 10. These four houses are known as angular or kendra houses in the horoscope and are considered to yield great strength. Planets occupying any of these are said to have full expression power to do what they indicate by nature as well as by lordship of houses in the chart. 
Houses 2, 5, 8, and 11 are called succedent or panaphara houses and planets therein are not as powerful as those in angular or kendra houses, but possess moderate strength. The weakest of all in influence are the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th houses, termed cadent or apoklima houses. A planet placed in a cadent house is supposed to have the least expressive power. 
One may, for instance, lack suitable opportunities at needed times, no matter what their merit or skill. 
The angular, succedent, and cadent houses respectively correspond to movable, fixed, and common signs of the zodiac in power and influence.

The 10th House: Lordship, Honour, Dignity, and Public Esteem

The 10th house is described as the house of lordship, honour, dignity, and public esteem. It is aptly called the apex of the horoscope, since it denotes man's worldly attainments achieved through name and fame, power and prestige, credit and conduct, success and status, rank and renown, respect and reputation, and ambition and authority. One's public life and popularity, his worldly standing in terms of material responsibility, and his connection with people in high positions should be judged from an examination of the strength of the 10th house, the occupants of the 10th house and those in their constellations (nakshathra), the lord of the 10th house and those in his constellations, and the planets conjoined with the 10th lord and those aspecting the 10th house. All questions concerning one's worldly activities and moral responsibilities are determined with reference to this house.

The 10th House Presides Over Preferment or One's Inclination for Permanency, Promotion, Advancement, and Appointment, Etc.

It Shows How One Acquires Superiority or Affluence - Whether by Being Engaged in Independent Pursuits or Business or in Professional Service, or by Occupying an Exalted Elective Office or Appointment.

The Influence of the 10th House
The chief influence of the 10th house is profession, occupation, or business. One cannot arrive at a judgement in regard to what pursuits one will follow from an examination of the 10th house alone. In this aspect, houses 2, 6, and 10 have to be investigated and studied together. These three houses are called the material trinity of houses, principally because they correspond to the 2nd, 6th, and 10th signs of the zodiac which are earthy signs representing material gains.

In day-to-day life, it is not unusual to find people who follow avocations for which they have neither the requisite aptitude nor the qualification required (indeed, people have no choice in choosing their vocation). There are others who change their occupation several times, and some others carry on two or more different lines of activity at the same time. In the vast majority of cases, one is forced to take to a particular vocation not because of any interest in it or any particular liking, but solely for monetary gain. Mantreswara in Phaladeepika fittingly uses the expression "Pravritti" in connection with the 10th house. Therefore, the 10th house may be taken as designating one's preferment in this respect for improvement. The 6th house shows service, routine monotonous work, and drudgery carried on by one under force of circumstances, whether he likes it or not. The 2nd house indicates the outcome of one's labour in monetary advantage: self-acquisition.

If Neptune Occupies the 10th House with Good Aspect from Other Planets

The native will fit well in occupations where secrecy, mystery, and inspiration are employed, such as secret service, inspirational writing, singing, music, art, etc. Neptune is called the Sea God, so one may have connections with sea and related industries. When Neptune in the 10th house is well-dignified, it portrays a highly inspirational nature, making the native capable of attaining honour and position through some unique achievement. It also threatens danger to the life of one of the parents. Unfavourable aspects to Neptune denote disgrace, discredit, and scandal, deserved or otherwise.

Uranus is said to be independent, erratic, eccentric, unconventional, and original by nature. If it is posited in the tenth house and is aspected well, one will originate new plans of work and follow uncommon pursuits, and come out successful. If Mercury indicates talent, Uranus denotes genius. Many inventors, reformers, explorers, astrologers, and great scientists are born with Uranus in the tenth house. Uranus rules suddenness, so sudden changes in occupation are indicated. Being bold, independent, and changeful, one invites opposition from the public and government bodies. Uranus afflicted denotes discredit and reverses, and extraordinary experiences in public or professional affairs.

The Slow and Sluggish Saturn, Well Dignified by Sign Position and Favourably Aspected, Causes One to Rise by Slow, Steady, and Patient Industry. There is, However, Liability to Interruption and Delay. Unless Saturn is Strong by Sign and Aspect, It Inclines to a Subordinate Position Generally. Affliction to Saturn Brings Public Discredit. The Native May Possess Merit but Lacks Opportunities and Encounters Impediments in Business. Disappointments in Professional Matters are Denoted Especially When Saturn's Period or Sub-Period is in Operation. Good and Bad Aspects to Saturn Show a Good Rise and Sudden Fall.

The Benevolent Jupiter Connected to the 10th House

The benevolent Jupiter being well connected to the 10th house is a definite indication of high honours and favour from those in high positions. Jupiter being the planet of justice and high morals, one's moral standard will be high and they will earn through right means. This is a very good testimony for political, social, and financial success. Depending on other considerations, it denotes positions such as judges, trustees, ministers, ambassadors, philosophers, stock brokers, bankers, merchants, etc. It includes all positions of distinction, trust, and responsibility. If afflicted, one may occupy subordinate positions in banks, courts, etc., or serve as a cashier.

The militant Mars, well dignified with good aspects, gives one energy and enterprise, force and courage, and good executive ability. One will be well qualified to captain any industry or conduct any business, especially if Mars is in a movable sign. The native succeeds best in martial occupations where fire, iron, or sharp tools are used in a skilled manner. Mars, being the planet of inexhaustible energy and enterprise, will, if well fortified, make the native fit for lines where courage or daring is necessary, or where skill is combined with muscular energy. If Mars is afflicted, one will exhibit excessive ambition, authority, arrogance, and aggressiveness, and will invite opposition and incur disfavour.

If the mutable planet Mercury is in 10th house of success in commission business or agencies and trading, one may expect success. All mental and occult occupations will be fruitful. Mercury points to plurality, so one may engage in several occupations at a time. One may be a rolling stone, changing occupations often. Generally, one succeeds in a subordinate capacity, as Mercury is a messenger and not a master. One may be employed in engineering, postal communication, export, import, or international trade, or be connected with any of these as a contractor or supplier.

The Passive and Peaceful Venus, Placed in the 10th with Good Aspect from Other Planets

The passive and peaceful Venus, placed in the 10th house with good aspects from other planets, is a sure indication of good will and patronage among ladies and success in social, artistic, or musical pursuits. Popularity is acquired more by an affable and good-humoured nature than by merit. Venus has sway over those occupations which deal with artistic, refined, and entertainment matters, and with all those businesses where women's needs are catered for. Success in such professions or occupations is a certainty.

The Dignified Sun: Unafflicted by Any
The sun is the surest sign of success, honour, distinction, authority, power, prosperity, high patronage, and public support. It assures success in governmental circles, and one's credit is secure and success is steady in whatever profession, occupation, or business they may be engaged in. Through the favour of superiors, one will rise and occupy positions of trust and responsibility. They will be esteemed by the community and honoured by election to a high public office.

The sun is a dependable planet, and one can depend upon it to justify the confidence reposed in them. One will be honest and upright in dealings and possess a good moral standard. The sun rules, among other things, over security of service, medicine, and government. If afflicted, one may be pompous and vainglorious, may exhibit wealth of power, and find difficulty in enlisting favour.

The Inconstant Moon: Its Influence on Public Life
The inconstant Moon is said to rule the general public, and so its position in the 10th house is a favourable indication for public life. However, due to the Moon's changeable nature, several changes in public life are also shown. If it is aspected well, it brings the person prominently before the public and ensures their favour, but popularity is generally unstable. There is a liability to fluctuation in business, occupation, or profession.

The Moon indicates changes and voyages, and so one may have many changes in connection with their profession, etc., or be engaged in professions or occupations which demand travelling about, especially if the Moon is in a movable sign. The Moon also rules public commodities, shipping, travelling, and affairs connected with common people and women. If it is aspected well, it denotes success in professions concerning these.

If afflicted, public scandal and censure cannot be ruled out.

The Tenth House: Karmasthana
The tenth house is termed 'karmasthana'. It includes doing the last rites to one's parents, performing religious functions, such as yagnas, and making money through work. It is sometimes a coincidence that, at the very time when one gets an advancement, they also lose either of their parents. The tenth house is the second to the ninth house, which denotes the father, and the seventh house to the fourth, which indicates the mother. Houses two and seven are marakasthanas, or death-inflicting houses, so it is not unusual that during the period or sub-period of the planets connected with the tenth house, one advances in business, profession, or occupation, and at the same time loses one of their parents.

The 10th house has reference to the employer, superior, master in trade or profession, judge, and the government. Being the 2nd house to the 9th, which represents the father, it is said to govern patrimony or one's inheritance. The 8th house suggests one's unearned income, and the 4th house is the 8th to the 9th, representing the father. Hindus refer to the 4th house for hereditary income which descends to one from ancestors. By reflection, the 10th house also governs these. The 10th house is called 'Agya' and rules orders or commands issued. The 9th house governs long journeys, while the 10th is related to pilgrimage to holy places.

In Uttara Kalamritam, Kalidasa elucidates that all information regarding trade, prosperity, honour from Government, honourable living, permanence, pre-eminence, seal of authority, horse riding, athletics, service, sacrifice, agriculture, doctor, name, fame, depositing a treasure, talisman, morality, medicine, thigh, prosperity, adopted son, teaching, intellect to command, and mantras should be sought through the 10th bhava. The author of Jatakadesamarga avers that it is through the 10th house that one ought to divine about one's honour, profession, dignity, position, or rank.

Bhattotpala Declares in Prasnagnana that the Tenth House Should be Examined for Matters Concerning Kingdom, Seal of Authority, Great Religious Merit, Position, Utility, and Rain, and Other Things Pertaining to the Sky
Vaidyanatha Dikshitar Mentions that One Will Gain Authority, Honourable Rank, Ornaments, Apparel, Activities, Agriculture, Retirement from the World, Beneficent Acts Sanctioned in the Scriptures, Means of Livelihood, Fame, Knowledge of the Special Arts and Learning Generally from the Tenth Bhava, Its Owner, the Sun, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn
Ramadayulu in Sanketanidhi Opines that One's Occupation, Family, Happiness, etc., Should be Deduced from a Look at the Tenth House. He Further Says that One's Meritorious Deeds, Trade, Occupation, Livelihood, Administrative Appointment, Happiness, Position, Action, and Sraddhas to Ancestors are to be Ascertained from This House. According to Him, the Two Knees and the Backbone of a Person are Governed by the Tenth House.
In Satya Samhita, the Author Inclines to the View that the Tenth House Has to be Examined in Order to Find Out One's Worldly Standing, Rank, and Eminence, as Well as Association with Virtuous People.
Prityusas, Son of Varahamihira, Asserts that All Information Pertaining to One's Occupation and Living, and All About One's Valour, Prowess, Learning, and Fame, and All Seen and Heard About a Person are to be Ascertained Through This House.

In Horary Questions, This House Concerns the Judges, Judgment, and the Substances Taken Away by the Thieves (Being the Fourth to the Seventh Denoting the Thief)
The Tenth House Stands for the Stewards and Their President in the Race Clubs, the Aristocracy of the Owners of the Horses, and the Trainers.

In mundane and political astrology, the 10th house deals with government in a general sense, its affairs, and its chief executive. It signifies the head of the state, whether monarch or president, as well as royalty, the party in office, the national leaders, the upper strata of society, those in authority, eminent and distinguished persons, and the aristocracy. It governs national trade, the nation's honour, integrity, credit, power, and status among the community of nations. This house provides a clue to guess the political situation prevailing in the country at any time.
The 10th house signifies the father's self-acquisition, being the second reckoned from the 9th. It is also the maraka house to both the father and mother; to the father, because it is in the 2nd to the 9th, and to the mother because it is in the 7th to the 4th. Being the fourth counted from the 7th house, it shows the permanent possessions or conveyance of the business or married partner. It rules the speculative and pleasurable pursuits of servants and their children, being the fifth from the 6th denoting servants. As the 10th house happens to be the 6th house taking the 5th as the first, it portrays ill-health to children or the debts incurred by them. Since it is the 7th to the 4th, it refers to the mother's opponents in litigation, election, etc. Danger to the younger brother or sister, their legacies, etc., are described by the 10th house which is the 8th house counted from the 3rd. It is the house of loss and secret inimical activities to one's elder brother or one's dear friends and their hospitalization.

### Eleventh House
The terms used to refer to the 11th bhava are: Ekadasa; Labha (profit or gain); Aya (income or all kinds of receipts); Agamana (acquisition); Apti (gain); Prapthi (what is unto one); Kama (desire, passion); Siddhi (fulfilment of one's desire); Vibhava (wealth or riches); Slaghyata (veneration, commendation); Sarasa (anything juicy or succulent).
Both the oriental and occidental astrologers are unanimous in describing the 11th house as the house of friends. It stands for all those who are allied to the native by likeness or sympathy of interest in society, community, etc. It includes one's favourites, flatterers, admirers, associates, advisers, adherents, supporters, well-wishers and close acquaintances (casual acquaintance is shown by the third house). Therefore, it is necessary to fix attention on the 11th bhava to find out the sort of friends one will acquire.
Houses 9, 10, 11 and 12 are termed Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha houses. "Kama" should not be construed to mean only passion. It also shows desire. 'Siddhi' signifies fulfilment. From the 11th house should be resolved all questions concerning one's hopes, wishes and aspirations and their realisation. The 11th house governs success in all undertakings, whether it be in profession or business, higher studies or foreign collaboration, election, litigation, speculation, writings, health, etc. Suppose one is engaged in litigation at the time when he is running the conjoined periods of the planets favourably connected to the 11th house. He will then come out successful, mostly by compromise, even though his case may be weak, as the 11th house stands for lasting friendship and gains.

The 11th House: Profit or Gain

The 11th house is most commonly referred to as 'Labhasthana', denoting profit or gain. It is through this house that every accumulation of incoming wealth is to be expected. One may earn by one's own exertion, which is indicated by the lagna. Self-acquisition is determined by the 2nd house. Earnings through short writings, agency, writings, younger brother, etc., are shown by the 3rd house. Money received through mother, vehicles, immovable property, treasure, etc., is described by the 4th. Gains in speculation, sports, lottery, amusement interests like cinema, drama, etc., and through children are governed by the 5th house. The 6th house denotes income through service, pet animals, or by borrowing. Income accruing to one through business partnerships, wife or husband, litigation, etc., is indicated by the 7th house. The 8th house has to do with insurance, provident fund, wills, legacies, etc. One may derive monetary advantage through foreign collaboration, contact with strangers, father, or by doing research, which is the influence of the 9th house. Lastly, one's income through profession, business, or inheritance is indicated by the 10th house. The 12th house of a horoscope shows all expenses, investments, and withdrawal of money from the bank. Therefore, houses 1 to 10 put together describe the various sources of one's income; the 12th house deals with expenses. Adding the income resulting from houses 1 to 10 and deducting the expenses indicated by the 12th house, one gets the net balance called profit. This is what is shown by the 11th house.

If one has lent money to someone, then the principal and interest are ruled by the eleventh house. On the other hand, if one has borrowed, then the fifth house deals with the discharge of debt. Why? Because the fifth house is the eleventh house counted from the seventh house, which denotes the person from whom the money has been borrowed.

So, good aspects to the significators connected with the 11th house signify the return of capital and interest by the person who has taken money on loan, and, on the same analogy, favourable aspects to the planets beneficially connected to the 5th house connote that the native will pay back the amount taken on loan, together with interest thereon.
The 11th house presides over many things, including pleasure, prosperity, profit, progress in attempts, peace after achieving aspirations, partnership, and permanent ties of friendship. This house also denotes the desire for reunion, so one must investigate this house to determine what kind of emotional attachments one will have. In fact, the 11th house is more accurate in determining a lover than the 7th house, as it stands for lasting friendship and intimacy that may lead to marriage. One may also live with pleasure with a member of the opposite sex without actually getting married. The 7th house shows to whom one is bound by legal ties, not necessarily a lasting friendship. If the significators connected to the 7th house and 11th house are favorably disposed, one may be successful in marriage. In matters concerning marriage, the 11th house should also be taken into account along with houses 2 and 7.

Investigating the 11th house can help one ascertain how successful they will be in social and financial matters. This house reflects the native's attitude towards society and their interest in group advantage rather than personal aims and ambitions. It also relates to reformative and unconventional activities.

Another Important Feature of the 11th House: Progeny or Rearing of Children

The 5th house chiefly deals with children, and by reflex action, the 11th house, which is the opposite of the 5th, is connected. Ramadayalu in Sanketanidhi provides support for this interpretation when he says that any bhava and its 7th will always have similar aims to be carried out. He clearly elucidates in Sloka 106 that the good or bad effects from the 11th house will be the same as the effects of the planets posited in the 5th and vice versa. Not only this, the 11th also happens to be the 5th counted from the 7th ruling the married partner.

The 11th House Governs Elder Brother or Sister
All information in this respect is indicated by the 11th House. Attention should be paid to the 11th House, the planets connected with it, its lord, etc., and judgement should be made accordingly.

The Eleventh House Indicates "Trusts". It Also Denotes the Financial Affairs of the Employer or Those in Command Over the Native, Being the Second to Tenth House.

In the physical body, it has domain over the left car, the right foot, the left hand, and the two shanks.

Vaidyanatha Dikshita suggests that one should look to the eleventh house to find out the accumulation of incoming wealth. He emphatically declares that the planet occupying the eleventh house, when strong, is capable of bringing prosperity and wealth.

Varahamihira refers to this house as "Aya," denoting one's income. He avers that the 11th house is one of the improving houses, or upachayasthanas. The sages say that even malefics placed in upachaya houses (3, 6, 10, and 11) prove auspicious and bring profit and pleasure.

Mahadeva in Jataka Tatva Calls the 11th House 'Labhasthana'

Mahadeva in Jataka Tatva calls the 11th house "Labhasthana". It indicates gains which accrue to a person, the nature of such gain being dependent on the nature of the planet connected. If it is a benefit, one will acquire wealth by fair means and by pursuit of right actions. If the planet therein be a malefic, one may earn by unfair means even. If the planets connected are both malefic and benefic, then in their respective periods or sub-periods one will resort to foul or fair methods, as the case may be, to attain one's objectives. Mahadeva also feels that the 11th house has to be seen to determine the type of vehicles one will have.

Kalidasa Mentions in Uttara Kalamritam the Following to be Deduced from the 11th House

Realisation of one's wishes and desires; acquisition of wealth, profit in every undertaking; varieties of income; one's influence, dependency, eldest brother, paternal uncle, undesirable nature (if afflicted); worship of deities and of the virtuous; devotion to God; respect to elders; gain of knowledge (10th stands for jnana; 11th is the 2nd from the 10th); high level of intelligence; the welfare of the employer; loss of interest on one's capital; possession of costly metals, ornaments, etc.; advising others; luck; easy gains; brother-in-law; mother's longevity (8th to the 4th house); left ear; the knee; attractive painting and arts; sarasa (juicy articles); hearing some pleasing and delightful music or happy news; ministership; dawn of fortune; and longevity.

In the Jataka Chandrika, it has been declared that the 11th house is the bhadhakasthana for persons born in movable signs (char rasis). For those whose births have fixed signs (sthira rasis) ascending, the 9th house is the bhadhakasthana and for those born with common signs (ubhayas rasi) in their Ascendant, the 7th house is the bhadhakasthana. For all natives, the 7th and 2nd houses are marakasthanas or death-inflicting houses, being respectively in 12th to the 8th house representing longevity and in opposition to the 1st and 8th houses. One should not go by the literal meaning of the 'bhadhakasthana' and conclude that it is evil in every respect. 'Bhadhakasthana' applies only to longevity and health. It has to be understood that during the period or sub period of the planet owning the bhadhakasthana or of the planet connected with the bhadhakasthana, whichever is the stronger of the two, one may suffer from ill-health or there may be anxiety in regard to one's health. If, according to the indications at birth, one is destined to live long, one will survive the period or sub period of the planets connected with the bhadhakasthana and only enjoy the beneficial results related to the 11th house. If one has lived the allotted span of life and their death is drawing near, the planets in the bhadhakasthana or its lord will operate at that time to put an end to life.

Ramadayalu in Sankethanidhi, when discussing the 11th house, makes it clear that all matters pertaining to the right foot, left hand, one's knowledge, income, wealth, good actions, horses, elephants, vehicles, chariots, furniture, ornaments, clothing, swinging cradles, beauty, festivity, decoration, etc., are to be ascertained from this bhava. He adds that a respectful offering, sovereign, money, daughters, friends, cattle, and good effects come under the purview of the 11th bhava.

The Author of the Jatakadesamarga Expresses the Opinion that Attainment of Efforts, Desire, and the Absence of Misery Can Be Predicted Through the 11th Bhava.

Bhattotpala ascribes elephant riding, horse riding, elephants, horses, and conveyances, clothing, crops, jewels, wisdom, and wealth to the 11th bhava and says that one should infer all information about these from it.

Sun in 11: An Indication of Lofty Actions and Desires

This is an indication of lofty actions and desires, and success in realizing them. One may associate with men in power and high positions who will remain firm, honorable, and steadfast in friendship. The native is sure to reap immense benefit through them. It is a good position for social success, provided other testimonies lend support.

Jupiter in this House Shows That One's Friends Will Be Wealthy, Virtuous, True, and Influential, Rendering All Assistance

Social success, popularity, and credit will be secured through friendship. One's ambitions will be achieved and hopes realized in full. Jupiter's situation here with good aspects from others connotes social, financial, and political success. If Jupiter is afflicted, then the friends may be sincere in their desire to help but will lack the ability to fulfill it, or they may serve their own interests by such friendship.

Mercury in 11th House Draws Many Acquaintances Among Literary and Scientific Minded People

Mercury being mutable by nature, none of them will be sufficiently steadfast in their affections, unless Mercury is well-aspected. If afflicted, one should not place any reliance on friends for assistance nor should they stand surety to them.

Moon in 11, Receiving Harmonious Aspects

The Moon in the 11th house, receiving harmonious aspects, shows a large circle of friends, especially among the female folk, patronage of women, and social success and popularity. The Moon is changeable by nature, so one will have few lasting attachments unless the Moon was well aspected at birth by planets in fixed signs or the Moon itself was in a fixed sign. If afflicted, those extending their hand of friendship will do so with the ulterior motive of deriving benefits from the native.

Saturn in the 11th House, Well Dignified by Occupation and Aspect

Saturn in the 11th house, well dignified by occupation and aspect, attracts aged and serious friends. One may contract friendship with those in subordinate positions. Saturn shows constriction; Jupiter, expansion. Therefore, Saturn in the 11th house shows few friends while Jupiter indicates a large number of friends. If Saturn is afflicted, one should be careful with aged people who would make use of the native for selfish ends and desert them when they are no longer of any use to them.

Saturn is a planet of limitation and restriction and its position in the 11th house does not augur well; for it portrays delay in the achievement of ambitions even when well aspected. When one follows the dasa bhukti system, the beneficial Saturn will give the favourable results in its sub-period and Saturn will not allow other planets to offer such results in their sub-periods which precede Saturn.

Mars in Eleventh House Brings Friends Among the Martial and Athletic Class
If well dignified, one works courageously and enthusiastically to realize their desires, leaving no stone unturned until success is sure. If afflicted, it makes one touchy and sensitive towards their friends. Mars is an ambitious planet and if afflicted, one is likely to overreach themselves in their desires and suffer consequently. If Mars is afflicted, it causes impulsiveness and rashness, thereby denoting disagreement with friends. If Saturn or Mercury afflict, violation of friendship and treachery is indicated. If the Sun, Jupiter, or Mercury aspect unfavorably, friends may offer wrong advice, landing one in trouble. If Venus or the Moon afflict, it indicates overindulgence with friends, especially female companions.

Venus in the 11th House, favourably aspected, portrays friendship with those of the opposite sex and those in social circles who will be ever ready to assist one in realizing their desires. One's friends may be humane and sympathetically and artistically inclined. This position of Venus favours a fruitful marriage. The 11th House shows fondness for society and Venus is said to be a social planet, so its situation here is conducive to success in social affairs. Afflictions to Venus often show that one's friends may prove to be ambitious and time-serving, and throw the native aside when opportunity offers.

Uranus in the 11th house is a strong influence that can bring about strange, sudden, and remarkable friendships. One will associate with those who are original, creative, or inventive, who can prove immensely helpful to the native if Uranus was well aspected at birth. As Uranus is a progressive planet, one's hopes will be progressive and peculiar. If affliction occurs, friends can suddenly turn out to be foes.

Neptune in 11, Well Aspected

If Neptune is well aspected in the 11th house, it gives a person high spiritual aspirations and will gift them with the ability to attract other people of a similar nature who may aid them in realizing their ambitions. If Neptune is afflicted, then those who pose as friends may prove deceptive and treacherous. Those with this position of Neptune afflicted should be careful when cultivating friendships.

In Political Astrology, the 11th House is said to indicate Parliament or equivalent legislative branches in other governments. It rules the Lok Sabha, the Lower House of State Assemblies, Corporations, Municipal Bodies, District Boards, Panchayats, and similar legislative bodies. It also bears relation to parties, legislation, governmental policies, and planning. It is related to international friendships and the exchange of amenities among nations. It deals with companies, stores, governing bodies, associations, etc., and all institutions where group-interest is involved. It represents the wealth and money of the "exchequer" or the government, as well as the friends and allies of the nation.

In Horse Racing, it denotes the management of the committee under the control of the Stewards. The number of the winner is shown by this House.

In Market Forecasting, This House is Taken for Government Loans for Electric Companies, Gas, Museums, Agriculture, Estates, Irrigation, Silk, etc.

11th House in Horary Astrology
In horary astrology, as in natal astrology, the 11th house is connected with hopes and desires and their fulfilment. If the 11th house is afflicted, the querist will suffer severe disappointment in the matter examined.

Being the 2nd from the 10th, it shows the financial gain derived from occupation. It rules over father's short journeys, gain through correspondence, editing, publishing, his younger brother or sister, etc. Being the 3rd counted from the 9th, it indicates the termination of a will or legacy. The 11th house concerns the birth of children, being the 5th from the 7th; it also shows partner's pleasurable pursuits, speculation, etc. It shows recovery from ill-health and victory over enemies, being the 6th reckoned from the 6th, which represents ill-health, enemies, and debts. As it is the 7th house from the 5th, it signifies the daughter-in-law, the children's competitors in examinations, etc. Being the 8th to the 4th, it stands for danger, difficulties, disappointment, and even death of the mother. To the younger brother or sister represented by the 3rd, it is the 9th house and hence is related to her/his long journeys in connection with education, etc. It is the house of success to the elder brother or sister if well fortified. It also signifies freedom from misery and pain and discharge from hospital, being in 12th to the 12th house.

### Twelfth House
The expressions ascribed to the 12th bhava are: Anthyabha (last house); Rippha; Lopasthana (house of disappearance); Bandha (bondage); Vigama Vyaya (loss, negation); Sayana (bed); Papa (sin); Daridrya (poverty, penury); Suchaha (tale bearer, backbiter); Kshaya (loss, decline); Dukkha (misery); Vama Nayana (left eye); Anghri (leg).

According to our ancients, the first eight houses of the horoscope indicate 'Ikaloka Sukham' or worldly pleasures and pains, while the last four, namely houses 9, 10, 11 and 12, denote 'Para Loka Sadhanam' or spiritual welfare. These last four houses are accordingly called Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha houses. The 12th house rules man's final emancipation from the chain of births and deaths, and his merger with the Cosmic Soul. Divine worship and the future state of existence are determined from the 12th bhava.

The 12th House Shows Loss, Impediments, Restraint, Limitation, Waste, and Extravagance; Expenses Outweighing Income, Drudgery, and Deception
Hindu sages have averred that the ownership of houses 6, 8, and 12, which are termed "Dus Sthanas," is productive of evil. No house is unfortunate or evil, unless afflicted, and this is true of the 12th house too.

Each house holds sway over certain distinct affairs, and when it is afflicted, one cannot expect the matters signified by it to manifest fully. Such contrary results will only be experienced when the native runs the period or sub-period of the planet afflicting the house under consideration, on the days, nakshatras, and lagnas ruled by it, and not otherwise. When the period or sub-period of the planet which is beneficially connected to the house under consideration follows, there is bound to be an improvement in the matters denoted by that house.

R.C. Smith, popularly known as the first Raphael, emphatically declares that evil planets in the twelfth house are far less evil than when angular.

The 12th House Deals with Loss, Expenses, Purchases, Investments, Donations, Charity, and Association with Philanthropic Institutions
For instance, one may purchase costly jewels if the planet connected has anything to do with the 2nd house, or incur expenses in connection with short journeys or writings and publications if the third house is connected. He may invest his money on landed or immovable property or go in for a vehicle when the 12th house will be connected. Also, he may be forced to spend on his mother going on a long travel, the 12th house being the 9th from the 4th house. One may speculate and lose or take up an insurance policy for his children's education or marriage and may be paying premiums if the 5th house has any relation. Therefore, there are various sources through which one may spend.

If One Has Borrowed, the 12th House Indicates Repayment of Loan
In Uttra Kalamritam, it has been said that the 12th house has to be investigated for repayment of loan. Discharge of loan is to be determined not only from the 12th house, but also from the 8th house. The 6th house indicates borrowing in the native's horoscope and the 7th house indicates the person who lends. The 6th house is the 12th to the person who has lent money, represented by the 7th house. The native's 12th house is the 6th reckoned from the 7th, and so has to do with discharge of debts. Suppose one has lent money to someone. In his horoscope, the 7th house shows the person to whom the money has been lent. The 12th house of the native, being the 6th reckoned from the 7th, indicates an increase in income to the person denoted by the 7th house, and a deterioration in the native's bank position. Therefore, one may lend money to others and thus incur expenses. Whether such expenses will be pleasant and expected or unpleasant and unexpected will depend upon the nature and lordship of the planets found in the 12th house, or of the planets in any manner connected with the 12th house. Such results will come to pass only when the period or subperiod of the significators connected with the 12th house operate, and not at all times. Furthermore, it is not the occupation or lordship of the 12th house that matters most. What is more important is the constellation (nakshatra) in which a planet is posited in the 12th house, and what houses are owned by the constellation lord to that particular horoscope. A planet in the 12th house in the constellation of, say, lords of 2 and 9, portrays long journeys and separation from family and going to a place far removed from home. Sorrow and sin, division and segregation, obstacles and impediments in one's way, misery and misfortune, poverty and persecution, intrigue and imprisonment, and secret toil of mind are some of the unfortunate matters coming under the influence of the 12th house.

The 12th House and Fear
The 12th house has a relation to fear, inferiority complex, anxiety, misgivings, and suspicion. It is known as the house of solitude, secret and silent suffering, and self-undoing. The 6th house focuses on ordinary service or help given to others, while the 12th house represents profound service rendered to mankind. The 12th house rules the extremities and shows the amount of freedom one enjoys and the degree to which one must submerge their own personality in service to other people. It is through the 12th house that one must decide all questions regarding seclusion and social barriers, the limitations and restrictions in one's way, and the unseen or unexpected troubles that one may suffer from. More appropriately, it is the house of the greatest self-sacrifice and shows unselfish deeds unconsciously prompted by conscience, likely as amends for wrongs committed in previous lives.

The 6th House According to Our Sages

Our sages have related the 6th house to inimical activity of an open nature, such as petty quarrels. It would be illogical to ascribe to the 7th house someone who is dearest to the native, such as a married partner, and in the same breath call it the house of open enemies. The 7th house stands for those who compete with the native in elections, litigation, etc., but who are not unfriendly towards the native, so they cannot be dubbed as inimical.

The 12th house is the 4th house reckoned from the 9th, which rules the higher mind. Counting inversely, it is the 4th house from the 3rd, which is concerned with lower or ordinary mental processes. Therefore, the 12th house has to do with secret workings of the mind. It has a bearing on such things as secret plots and schemes, conspiracy and cunningness, envy and malice, fraud and treachery, intrigue and deception, and suicide, murder, or assassination. It is also connected with exile and extradition and matters concerning these.

Neptune is associated with secrecy, mystery, mediumship, psychic research, and occult investigations. When Neptune is in a good position with other planets, it brings success in matters carried out in secret. The native is best suited for detective work and will gain through secluded and quiet methods. If Neptune is afflicted, it can lead to confinement in a hospital due to a chronic disease or insanity, detention in prison or a public institution, and many secret enemies. It can also indicate nefarious schemes, deception, fraud, scandal, disgrace, and secret sorrows. One may live in vague dread of some unknown danger.

Uranus Occupying 12th House and Well-Aspected

Uranus occupying the 12th house and being well-aspected tends to success through occult affairs and the invention of chemical processes which remain secret, even when promoted by the planet. If afflicted, it denotes danger from animals, accidents causing detention in out-of-sight places, disgrace and troubles from psychic or occult sources, sudden illness defying diagnosis, restraint in public institutions, and even exile from the country. One may face strange and sudden enmities and feel irritated and annoyed by the underhanded actions of eccentric people.

Saturn, the Planet of Seclusion, placed in the 12th House and well-aspected, points to success in seclusion or laborious occupations. If Saturn is possessed of strength by sign, position, etc., it shows that seclusion is self-invited. Taken alone, the position shows that secret enemies will steadily work for the downfall of the native. There is the likelihood of danger or contusions and bruises through animals. Saturn rules reserve and restriction, so one is inclined to prefer work in a quiet and peaceful way, unnoticed by others. If Saturn is afflicted, some lingering illness to the partner is denoted, as it is the 6th House reckoned from the 7th. If Mars seriously afflicts, there is the liability to danger of violence, robbery, or even suicide. Mercury rules the mental system and its affliction to Saturn causes mental disorder; also loss by theft, etc.

"Uranus in an adverse aspect is a very bad indication, as all the malefic matters mentioned in regard to the 12th house will come to the fore."

The Benevolent and Philanthropic Jupiter Well-Aspected in the 12th House

The well-aspected Jupiter in the 12th house gives one gain and success through occupations carried on in seclusion, such as in asylums, hospitals, and public or philanthropic institutions. It ensures success in places remote from the place of birth and with large animals. Jupiter in 12 enables one to eventually succeed over enemies and gain from them. Jupiter is expansive in nature, and those having Jupiter in 12 will be recipients of large aid from charitable institutions. If they are already rich, they will give away lavishly to those in need and to philanthropic institutions.

Mars in 12th House and Well-Aspected

Mars in the 12th house, when well-aspected, makes one an administrator of an estate or in a public institution. Generally, Mars here causes trouble through impulse, loss of reputation or treachery from enemies or misplaced affection. If afflicted, it portends danger of violence from enemies in a fight and danger of injuries through large animals. Mars has influence over violence and blood. The 12th house is connected with large animals and beasts, so effusion of blood can be expected as a result of kicks or thrusts from animals if there is affliction to Mars. This is suggested by way of a brief to the discerning students as to how to blend the nature of the house and the characteristics of a planet and one should not rush to a conclusion "Oh! Mars is for violence and 12th house shows animals. So danger of violence through animals is denoted." 

If Mars is well dignified by sign position and connected with the Sun and the 10th house, one may serve as a surgeon in a hospital (Mars for surgery, Sun for medicine). One's station in life should also be borne in mind before coming to a conclusion. If one were connected with a circus company and had a period of Mars in 12, weak by sign and by house ownership and the planet afflicting Mars, then one can expect danger of violence from animals and even death. In fact, in the horoscope of one gentleman connected with the circus, there were afflictions to Mars in 12 and on a certain day when he was playing with a lion in the circus ring, he was kicked and mauled by it.

Mars in 12th house, seriously afflicted by Saturn, may lead to imprisonment or illness caused by lingering disease and confinement in a hospital for a long time. If a factory manager were to have Mars in this position, then he will have recurring labour troubles often and the labour class will secretly work for his downfall.

Venus in the 12th House

Venus in the 12th house, when well aspected, contributes to success in occupations connected with jails, hospitals, or charitable institutions, or by work in a chemical laboratory. One may also benefit by pursuing obscure occupations. This placement of Venus may also incline one to investigate the secret arts or study and practice the occult. Venus, the planet of love in this house, makes one love and enjoy voluntary seclusion. One may also find pleasure in dealing with large animals, such as horses, and may enjoy hunting. The 12th house also indicates "suha sayanam," which suggests comfort in bed. Generally, this position of Venus makes one go after the opposite sex, and if Venus is afflicted, it can lead to enmity with women. Neptune or Uranus afflicting Venus suggests peculiar love affairs and sudden changes of affections, leading to sorrow, suspicion, disappointment, and divorce. Saturn afflicting Venus is said to cause separation generally, while Mars makes one a moral wreck, overindulging in passions. If Venus is in the 12th house, identical with Scorpio (Vrischika), and is afflicted, then it can indicate confinement in a hospital due to a disease caused by overindulgence of passions, as Scorpio rules the generative organs. Taurus also governs, by reflex action, self-abuse. Therefore, even if Venus occupies its own sign, Taurus, in the 12th house, it will, if severely afflicted, force one to undergo hospital treatment for venereal complaints.

If Mercury is in this House
If Mercury is in this house, it gives a mind peculiarly suited to delve into the mysteries and success in scientific or occult research. When well aspected by Mars and Saturn, who are themselves dignified by occupation, one will be admirably suited to detective work. Mercury has to do with publicity, but the 12th house shows limitations and so one is better fitted to out-of-sight work and occupations requiring seclusion rather than sociability and publicity. Mercury is an intellectual planet and will certainly give one the faculty to go into the most intricate details in matters which seem trivial or microscopic to others. Harmonious aspects from Herschel enable one to pursue unusual lines of thought.

If afflicted, especially by malefics like Saturn or Mars, it points to nefarious schemes, forgeries, plots, and conspiracies. Take alone, Mercury here indicates petty worries, annoyance, and small enmities caused by writings or scandalous reports, as Mercury rules correspondence. The mind is self-absorbed and narrow.

Sun in 12, Dignified and Well-Aspected

Sun in 12, when dignified and well-aspected, secures one success in occult and psychic matters and gives uncommon tastes. Sun is otherwise called Dhanwantari and so work in hospitals is favored. One loves and succeeds in some quiet, secure but obscure occupation such as in a chemical laboratory or in prisons or other institutions of confinement. A well-aspected Sun in 12 is a sure sign of sympathies and self-sacrifice and that one will rise steadily out of obscurity due to one's own merit and effort. Scholars say that Sun here vanquishes enemies.

Generally, Sun in 12, when weak by sign and afflicted, shows enmity of influential people, life in remote places, and separation from one's kith and kin.

Moon Rules the Public
Moon rules the public, and its situation in this house of seclusion and solitude favors success in such work as it is performed in hospitals or prisons, provided it is well-aspected. Moon is emotional and inconstant, and changeful, and consequently there is a liability of the senses dominating reason, involving one in clandestine love affairs. However, if Moon is in a fixed sign and well-aspected, one will keep the secret to himself.

Moon Rules Voyage
Moon also rules voyage. If Moon is in a watery sign in the 12th house, one may be connected with an occupation concerning shipping, etc. This indication is strengthened if the Moon is in conjunction with, or receives a favorable aspect from Neptune, the Sea Lord. An afflicted Moon in the 12th house signifies limitations, hindrances, fanciful fears, enforced retirement or sickness due to acts of indiscretion; also petty enmities with womenfolk causing worry and trouble. According to Haly, "it represents banished persons, male-factors, lost goods never recovered, long hidden wrath, vile persons, reproaches and disobedience."

Adila and Zeal, two very ancient Western astrologers, remark that the twelfth house is the house of captives and imprisonment; the place of imprisonment and the person that is imprisoned. The author of Phaladeepika calls this house "Leenasthana," meaning a hidden house. The twelfth house has to be examined in matters concerning occultism and the hidden side of life. Alan Leo observes thus: "The twelfth is related to the psychic mind in which receptivity or mental sensitiveness to the unseen world is awakened. Therefore, it is known as the house of self-undoing, which, in some cases, may mean the breaking up of the concrete physical condition by leaning towards the occult side of things. It is the house of 'one occultism.' The twelfth house, then, may denote sorrow in matters of an external, purely physical type; trouble and difficulty in matters of an emotional character; annoyance, worry, and anxiety in matters intellectual or mental, but in this relation, it may also bring joy and peace.

Mantreswara states that the 12th house rules 'Sayana'. Therefore, one must investigate this house to determine whether they will have sound sleep or not. The third house shows one's awakening from sleep, the 6th house signifies trance, and the 9th relates to dreams. Kalidasa differs in this respect, as in Uttara Kalamritam he states that the 12th house also indicates 'Nithra banga' or awakening from sleep or disturbance to sleep. If one runs the period of a malefic planet placed in the 12th house and afflicted by others, how can they expect a sound and peaceful sleep?

In Uttara Kalamritam it has been mentioned that the 12th house has to be referred to in connection with paternal wealth. This is likely because the 4th house indicates one's permanent possessions, and the 12th house is the 4th from the 9th representing the father, thus denoting the father's permanent possessions which may pass on to the native after the father's death. The Moon is always for change, and so one's father may change their residence when the Moon is in the 12th house, which is the 4th house counted from the 9th. Such changes will take place when the native runs the Moon's period or sub-period.

According to Kalidasa, one must investigate the 12th house accounts for the following: mental pain and agitation; the feet; the left eye; fear from enemies; mutilation of a limb; bodily injury; harm; wretchedness; imprisonment; anger; elephants; horses; loss by marriage and loss of wife; a blow to the thought of the happiness of parents or brothers; going to another place; liberation from pain; discharge of debts; paternal wealth; renouncing couch, termination of appointment, death, entry into heaven, and expenditure in various ways. Vaidyanatha Dikshitar says in his work "Jataka Parijatham" that visits to far-off places have to be predicted with reference to the 12th bhava. He adds that an individual's dignity, comfort of bed, sayana, etc., misfortune, and waste of wealth have to be ascertained from the strength of the 12th house, its lord, and Saturn, the karaka or the chief governor for the 12th house matters. He asserts that if the wandering Moon is in 12th identical with a movable sign or aspected by Saturn, then one will roam about. A waxing Moon receiving beneficial aspects makes one liberal and philanthropic. He will be virtuously disposed and will indulge in doing meritorious deeds. He may also be engaged in agriculture. A Moon favourably aspected by the passionate Venus gives comforts of bed.

Ramadayalu mentions in Sanketanidhi that the twelfth house rules the feet. He further states that this is the house of vyaya, or loss. Loss may also refer to a deterioration in the person's financial position. Suppose one has beneficial aspects in their horoscope between the lords of the eighth and twelfth houses, and they have taken out a loan. This aspect foretells the successful repayment of the loan, as it is a good aspect between the second and sixth house lords of the lender, indicating financial gain for them.

The 12th House Signifies the Issuance of Cheques. The 8th House is the Receipt of the Cheque by the Person Denoted by the 7th. Therefore, Benefic Planets in the 12th and 8th Houses, with Good Aspects Between Them, Promise the Return of a Loan.

The Author of Sanketanidhi Says That Sudden and Unexpected Demands, Pressure for Money, Unusual Expenses Far in Excess of Income, Gifts, Charities, Donations, Construction of Wells, Reservoirs, Etc., Virtuous or Sinful Actions for a Person, Punishments from Any Source, Fines, Losses, Etc., Come Under the Domain of the 12th House. Death May Result During the Period of the Planet That Has Connection with the 12th House in Any Manner.

The Author of Jatakadesamarga Suggests Seeking Information from the 12th House

The 12th house is related to places of segregation such as jails, asylums, and other institutions of correction or detention, where liberty is curtailed. Alan Leo states that it is the house of the voluntary recluse, as well as of the pauper, the invalid, and the prisoner. It denotes association with hospitals, sanatoriums, or nursing homes, as well as mental institutes. It has to do with convent or monastic life. One may be confined to bed in a hospital due to ill-health, or they may be a medical attendant. Therefore, a careful examination of the 12th house and of the planets connected with it is necessary. If the planet in the 12th house has anything to do with houses 2, 6, and 10, then service in a hospital is indicated. If the planet in 12 has no connection with houses 2 and 10, but has to do with the 6th house alone, then one may be admitted for treatment in a hospital. Thus, one should proceed.

The 6th House and the Planets Connected with It

The 6th house and the planets connected with it explain ordinary ill-health and disease, more especially of an acute nature, the duration of the disease, and recovery from it. The 8th house represents the fatal nature of the disease, causing mental disturbance and anxiety to life. The 12th has sway over chronic diseases, requiring confinement to bed in connection with treatment.

The Twelfth House Indicates Life in a Foreign Place

The twelfth house indicates life in a foreign place, change of place, or a thorough change in surroundings and environment. It is not necessary that one should go to a foreign country and settle down there; any place other than the native's permanent place is to be construed as foreign. If the fourth house lord goes to the twelfth, it denotes that one will have a change of residence or a thorough change in environments. If the ninth house is in any manner connected to the twelfth house, i.e., if the lord of the ninth is in the twelfth or is conjoined with the lord of the twelfth, or the planet in the twelfth is situated in the constellation ruled by the lord of the ninth, it is a definite indication of a long journey and life in a foreign place.

The Sixth House is said to signify pet animals, birds, and small cattle generally, while the Twelfth House stands for large cattle, beasts, etc.

L. George states that the 12th house is the house of affliction, representing trials and tribulations, sorrow, and self-undoing that can arise from treachery or persecution by secret enemies, the bonds of restriction, want, poverty, ignorance, or disease. Kidnapping, arson, looting, rape, poisoning, bootlegging, smuggling, and blackmailing are all under the influence of the 12th house.

In Racing, the Twelfth House Presides Over the Feet, Limitations, and Restrictions Imposed on Horse Owners, as Well as the Barring of Jockeys from Riding Due to Fraud and Deceptive Action, Etc.

In Horary Questions, the 12th House Must Be Looked At in Questions Connected with Grief, Persecution, Secret Mental Toil, Envy, Malice, Misery, Sedition, Treason, Assassination, Suicide, Deceit, Sorrow, Weeping, and Blackmailing.

In Prasnagnana, the author inclines to the view that information regarding enjoyment, disputes (litigation or quarrel), charity, donations, sacrifices, and agricultural operations should be sought through the 12th bhava.

In State Astrology, the 12th House Deals with Philanthropic, Charitable, and Reformative Institutions

The 12th house deals with philanthropic, charitable, and reformative institutions, jails, asylums, homes for the afflicted, and hospitals. It also refers to crime in general, criminals, spies, underground movements, and secret enemies of the nation at home or abroad. Secret and occult societies are also governed by this house, as well as monasteries and other forms of institutional religion.

This house signifies the substance or money of elder brothers or friends, being the second from the eleventh. As it happens to be the fourth from the ninth, it represents the father's permanent possessions, vehicle, etc. It signifies the sickness of the wife or husband, their debts, etc., being the sixth reckoned from the seventh. Being the seventh counting the sixth as the first, it represents the litigation, etc., of the servants. Being the eighth from the fifth house, it denotes danger, difficulties, and disappointment to children. It denotes long journeys for the mother, her foreign travels, and success achieved in writing, etc., being in nine to four. Since it is the tenth from the third house, it shows the profession, popularity, prosperity, etc. of the younger brothers or sisters.

## Sun: The Father of the Stars
Astronomy tells us that the Sun is the parent of the entire solar system, and is also known as the "Father of the Stars". It is the nearest star to Earth, located about 93 million miles away. It is the largest of the planets in the solar system, being nearly 750 times larger than all the other planets combined. Its diameter is about 10 times that of Earth, and it has a circumference of nearly 27,19,000 miles.

Scientists believe that the Sun is not a solid mass, but is composed of gaseous matter in a series of layers. It emits cool and positive magnetic rays which interact with the negative qualities on Earth, creating heat and light. These waves also affect all the other planets in the solar system, though the intensity varies depending on various factors.

Mythology: Being the center of all life, force, and energy and the giver of prana, Sun is worshipped as Sun God. It is held in high esteem. At least thrice daily, Sun is prayed for by Hindus. Every Sunday, Surya Namaskaram is done by many persons to regain lost vitality and eyesight. Other nations also pay reverence to Sun; it is said to represent the other Creator, the Brahma, with his four faces to have a survey of all four directions causing four seasons and the four elements, namely, fire, earth, air, and water. Sundays (otherwise called Sabbath, meaning wise teacher) are given holidays probably to worship him. Sunday is also put at the head of all seven days of the week.
Westerners call the Sun, Apollo. They consider the Sun is the son of Jupiter and Latona. Apollo is the brother of Diana. He is adored by the Greeks. The swan and the raven are said to be Apollo's birds.
Hindus have conceived the Sun as ever moving in a chariot drawn by seven horses. This is probably because in the Sun are contained all seven colors of the solar spectrum (VIBGYOR). They say that Sun goes round the mount Meru daily. Whenever Sun enters into certain significant signs, the Hindus perform some religious function on those days to satisfy the departed soul and also offer prayers to Sun God. One such occasion is at the time when Sun crosses the fixed Nirayana Vernal Equinox and enters Aries so that people in the North Pole could see him after a continuous night extending to six months. This is called Vishu or Tamil New Year's Day. The next occasion is on or around July 17 when Sun reaches the northernmost declination (twenty-three degrees twenty-seven minutes from the celestial equator) and begins its southern course. It is called Dakshinayana. The next occasion when they perform the religious rites falls when Sun during its southern course reaches the Autumnal Equinox which is the beginning of Libra or Thulam. Three months later, when Sun reaches the southernmost declination in the south and just when he commences the northern course, all Hindus irrespective of caste or creed uniformly celebrate this day. It is called Sankaranthi. Thus, the Sun has come to occupy an important place in the Hindu Pantheon.

The Greatest Astrologer Varahamihira worshipped only the Sun God and shed an imperishable lustre among the nine gems in the court of King Vikramaditya. The Sun takes exactly one year to go round the ecliptic, and it only has a direct motion; it never retrogrades, and there is no latitude to the Sun.

Sun as a Symbol of Spirit
Hindus consider the Sun to be the soul of Kalapurusha. It is said that the several constituents of Kalapurusha are either strong or weak according to the strength of the planets representing them, with the exception of Saturn. When Saturn is weak, misery will be much greater and will predominate, but if Saturn is strong there will be less of misery. All these effects are felt only in their respective periods.

For all living beings, the Sun represents the positive and primal fount, while the Moon represents the negative influence in preservation and formative. The Sun is constructive and creative, while the Moon is the mother. Therefore, the Sun is the symbol of spirit and the Moon is that of matter, both acting as life and form. This is why the zodiac, which is divided into 12 signs, is in its nature alternatively positive and negative or masculine and feminine.

The Sun and Moon are considered to be the sovereign, while Guru or Jupiter and Sukra or Venus are the counselors or ministers. Budha or Mercury is their herald or the young prince, Kuja or Mars is the commander-in-chief, and Saturn or Sani is the slave of the servant. The Sun is the king and the Moon is the queen. Venus is considered to be the wife of Jupiter and the adviser.

Other names of the Sun are Adithya, Arka, Aruna, Bhanu, Dhinakara or Dhinakrit, Hell, Pusha, Ravi, Surya, and Thapana.

The Sun's Governance
The Sun and Moon are the two luminaries as they both emit light and make everything bright. The Sun has a form with dark eyes. It is the Sun that pours forth its spirit and it is the one planet that gives life to one and all. The Chaldeans worshipped the Sun with great love and devotion. The Sun offers us the power of resistance and vitality. It governs the inspiration and expiration, i.e., the breath of life. It also rules over our consciousness and denotes the individuality, while the form and personality are attributed to the Moon. The Sun gives the force and self-will and makes one determined and decisive.

The Sun is a dry, masculine, positive, and hot planet. It is 'Agni Devatha' and is fiery by nature. It rules the direction East and (of the six Rithus) 'Grishma' which includes the months of June and July. The colour of the Sun is orange or Kauakambaram. It rules the metal Gold and also Copper. The Sun represents the Father of the native. In a woman's chart, it indicates her husband. In service, it shows the master or the administrative head or the Government. In games, it stands for the captain or the leader.

Physical Features: People with the Sun as the ruling planet, born either on a Sunday or in Leo-Simha Lagna or with the Sun in the Ascendant, will have honey-coloured eyes. The face will be large and round. The hair and the colour of the body will have a light shade.

The Significance of the Sun in the Physical Body

The Sun rules the heart, and the sign which it governs, Leo Simha, denotes the heart of the Kala-purusha. It also represents the right eye in men and the left eye in women. The mouth, spleen, throat, and brain are also indicated by the Sun.

Diseases Caused by Sun Affliction
When the Sun is afflicted by another planet, it can cause defects in the heart or eyesight during the period of the Sun and the afflicting planet. Saturn afflicting the Sun causes low blood pressure, while Jupiter afflicting the Sun produces high blood pressure. Mars afflicting the Sun can cause haemorrhage, cardiac thrombosis, and other ailments. The constitution may be overheated and bilious. It can also denote cerebral meningitis, eruptions of the face, loss of speech due to cerebral affection (aphasia), sharp fevers, typhoid, polypus, epilepsy, bile complaints, sunstroke, scorches, and diseases of the head.

Characteristics of a Strong and Beneficial Sun
When the Sun is not afflicted but is strong and beneficial, it offers sterling qualities. It fosters real love towards everything and everybody, as well as devotion to God that is sincere and steady. Activity, authority, steadiness, soundness, and solidarity in one's avocation are all attributed to the Sun. It also indicates one's self-acquisition and the ability to make strenuous efforts, roam over mountains, undertake travels, and take all pains to gain one's objective. Maximum labour and minimum wages are also attributed to the Sun.

A strong Sun in a favourable sign offers strong will and a cheerful outlook towards life, as well as good fortune. However, one should not be too frank and outspoken, and should cultivate caution and secretiveness. The Sun gives power to rise far above the status in which one is born, as well as a magnetic quality and ambition. Sun's subjects are tireless workers, but should avoid boasting over others and should not be over-ambitious lest they should feel discontented or unhappy.

Those who have a strong Sun should go directly to seek favour from anybody, as the magnetic radiation of the Sun is carried with them and the person sought out cannot refuse to grant the request. By exercising self-control and limiting one's ambition, one will enjoy the good-will and the esteem of the people in powerful positions and also from the public. Similarly, high government officials can enjoy life and earn the good will of the public.

Beneficial Sun Gives Ambition, Boldness, Brilliance, Capacity to Command, Dignity, Energy, Elevation in Rank, Faith, Fame, Grace, Generosity, Health, Hope, Happiness, Individuality, Influence, Joy, Kind Heart, Kingly Appearance, Loyalty, Magnanimity, Nobility, Optimism, Power, Sterling Quality, Respect for Elders, Reputation, Royalty, Regality, Scruples, Success in Worldly Affairs, Truth, Good Temperament, Unadulterated Love, Vigour, Vitality, Virtue, and Warmth.

The Effects of an Afflicted Sun: Arrogance, Bluffing, Domineering, Egoism, Faithlessness, Vain-Gloriousness, Haughtiness, Insulting, Jealousy, Lavishness, Loquaciousness, Over-Ambition, Pompousness, Pride, Self-Opinionatedness, Irritability, Anger, and Spitefulness.

Profession
The Sun generally indicates a permanent position in life. All government services and those in such departments where there is security of service are denoted by the Sun. The Sun also indicates an independent business financed by the father or the business taken over from him. The Sun as an indicator of profession gives success to one who deals in red or orange articles, such as copper, gold, wheat, medicine, and chemicals. The nature of the profession will, however, largely depend on the combination of the Sun with other planets. 

For example, if the Sun is connected with the Moon and Mercury, the native will deal in red or orange clothes, as the Moon and Mercury jointly indicate textiles; alternatively, one may be employed with this combination in a government textile department, since the Sun represents government and the Moon and Mercury denote textiles. If the Sun has any connection with the Moon and Venus, the native may deal in red or orange paints or may serve in a transport or shipping department. If Mars and Mercury are connected with the Sun in any manner, the native may be a military engineer or may deal in brick kilns or serve in a government press, as Mars and Mercury indicate press or mechanical or military engineering, etc. The Sun, Mars, and Venus promise service, as Venus stands for vehicular traffic and transport and Mars for police in the traffic department. Those who deal in rose flowers will be influenced by these three planets, as Venus is for flowers, Mars shows his possession of landed property and red colour, and the Sun indicates thorny plants. 

The Sun having a relation with Saturn suggests that one will deal in woollen goods, as Saturn also denotes hair (export of hair collected from certain famous temples is done by one who is born Cancer having the Sun in Karthik 1st pada aspected by exalted Saturn). For people who enter into the medical services as indicated by the Sun, the following combinations of planets will indicate the nature of their specialisation: the Sun with Jupiter produces good physicians and Mercury gives intuition and helps to diagnose correctly; the Sun receiving beneficial aspects from Mars brings out able surgeons, as Mars indicates the use of sharp instruments; the Sun, Venus, and Jupiter help specialisation in maternity, since the Sun denotes medicine, Venus women, and Jupiter the chief governor for children; if Venus receives aspects from the active and bold Mars and the secretive Saturn and is conjoined with the Sun, the person will be an expert in venereal diseases; if the Sun and Saturn are mutually connected, the person will specialise in skin diseases, as Saturn spoils the beauty given by Venus; the Sun and Venus devoid of other planets' influence occupying the sixth or the eighth house show that he will be an optician; and the Sun and Saturn in the Ascendant or in the 8th house indicate that one will earn as a dentist.

In one's chart, the Ascendant shows the native and the 7th house indicates the patient whom they treat. If the 2nd and 12th houses are afflicted, one has an eye defect or disease. Therefore, the 2nd and 12th houses from the 7th are the 8th and 6th houses counted from the Ascendant. Therefore, the planets Sun and Venus in the 6th and 8th in the medical officer's chart show that they will attend to people suffering from eye diseases.

One suffers from toothache only when the 2nd and 7th houses are afflicted. Therefore, the 2nd and 7th houses counted from the 7th house representing the patient are the 8th and Ascendant of the doctor. Hence, dentists will have Sun and Saturn having a connection with these two houses. Furthermore, Saturn rules the osseous system, bones, enamel, etc. Sun and Mercury in the 9th or 5th house indicate that the native will be an expert in Ear, Nose and Throat diseases, as the 3rd and 11th houses denote ear and throat.

If Rahu, Sukra, Sun, Uranus and the lord of the 9th house are in any manner connected with each other, the medical man will specialize in X-ray. If Uranus has a connection only with the Sun, the native will serve in the medical research department. Generally, Sun and Jupiter having a connection with Virgo or Kanni, Scorpio or Vrischika show service in the Public Health department, whereas Sun and Mars indicate service in the medical department. Similarly, if one takes to other departments of the Government, for example law, then Jupiter with Sun and Mercury indicates civil laws, whereas Mars indicates Criminal Law.

To find out one's profession exactly, a deep study is necessary. 

Political: The sun symbolizes administrators, kings, dictators, royal leaders, heads of departments, and people in positions of authority and power.

Products: Sun represents a variety of products, including rice, myrobalams, groundnut, coconut, assafoetida, cardamons, almonds, chillies, omum (Ajwan), pepper, milagu, pine, foreign exchange and currency, trade associations recognized by lavender, nutmeg, aromatic herbs, saffron, pearls, corals, etc.

Market: Government loans, gold bonds, gilt-edged securities, gold, its price and control, the Reserve Bank, stock exchange, government, chambers of commerce, etc.

Plants and Herbs: Thorny trees, grass, timber, saffron, laurel, orange trees, anise, cedar, almond, vervain, chamomile, lavender, rue, rosemary, marigold, and medicinal herbs.

Sun Signifies Grishma Rithu (i.e., June and July).

Places: Forests, Mountains, Shiva Temples, Fortresses, Government Buildings, Public Offices, District Boards, Panchayat Unions, etc. in Sourashtra Country, India.

Animals and Birds: Lions, Horses, Boars, Serpents, Cattle, and other Quadrupeds in the Forest; all singing Birds, such as the Nightingale and Swan.

Day: The Sun is the lord of Sunday. Whenever one runs a period ruled by the Sun, they can expect the results on a Sunday ruled by the Sun or at the time when Leo or Simha Lagna, owned by the Sun, rises in the east or on the days when the Moon transits in the stars or nakshatras of Karthigai, Uthrapalguni, and Uthrashada, which are governed by the Sun.

Numbers 1 and 4.

Precious Stones: Diamond and Ruby
If the Sun is weak or afflicted, one can use metal gold and the stones diamond and ruby set in it. Those who suffer from heart trouble, eye diseases, or those who want security in service or power in government, or favour from high government officials, can use the above gems to enjoy health and success. They will be able to realize their ambition.

So far, the general results of the Sun have been discussed. However, the general results will not apply to everyone without modifications. It will vary according to the houses which it occupies at the time of birth of a person.

## Moon: The Mother
In astrology, the Moon and the Sun are generally mentioned, even though neither is a planet in the strictest sense of the word.

Astronomy: The Moon is the planet closest to the Earth. It is the only planet in the Solar System that orbits around the Earth. The Sun is said to be the generator of power, while the Moon is considered to be the conductor of power lent by the Sun. Only one half of the Moon receives light from the Sun and this portion alone is illuminated at any one time. The Moon shines only by the reflected light of the Sun.

The rays of the Sun reflected by the Moon dispel the darkness of the night on Earth, just as light reflected from a mirror placed in the Sun removes the darkness inside a house. Therefore, the nature of the Moon's light is the same as that of sunlight, but it is not self-luminous. The distance between the Earth and Moon is approximately 238,000 miles. It orbits around the Earth, which in turn orbits around the Sun.

Suppose a child holds the hand of its mother; the child goes around her rapidly. But the mother with the child makes a large circle around a lighthouse. The child will be at times in between the mother and the lighthouse. On some occasions, the mother will be between the child and the lighthouse. When the child is in the line joining the mother and the lighthouse, the mother cannot see the lighthouse. In this manner, a solar eclipse is caused. But if the mother is in between the child and the lighthouse in the same joining line, the mother prevents the light from falling on the child. That is, the Earth is in between the Moon and the Sun, and the Moon does not receive light from the Sun. Thus, a lunar eclipse is caused. Eclipses are formed in this manner whenever all three are in one line.

The Moon is small in size. The diameter of the Earth is approximately 7,800 miles, while that of the Moon is only 2,200 miles. No water is said to be found on the Moon. But at the time of the Full Moon, we notice the tides rise as high as 40 feet. Actually, the ebb and flow of the oceans are caused by the influence of the Moon on the Earth.

Mythology: Moon as the Virgin Mary of Roman Catholics and Nourishing Mother of the Heavens
The Moon, also known as Luna or Diana, is the queen of the night and the twin sister of Apollo. She is the goddess and huntress who governs chastity and fertility, and is the daughter of Leo and Zeus, known as Artemis by the Greeks. It is said that the Sun gives spirit and life to all the planets, while the Moon rules over the lives of beings on Earth. The Sun represents individuality, while the Moon shows one's personality, and is also said to represent the mother of a person born by night. The Sun is masculine and the Moon is feminine, so a person born under the rulership of the Moon is said to be timid, vacillating, receptive, and convertible. The Moon is a watery planet, while the Sun is a fiery one, making the Moon a fruitful planet.

The Moon transits quickly through all twelve signs of the Zodiac in 27 days, 7 hours, and 48 minutes, and is said to govern our daily happenings. When it transits a favourable sign, a person may feel jubilant, and when it passes in an unfavourable sign, the same person may feel depressed. Therefore, it is important to understand the Moon and its effects. He will be attached to his mother and will be very much devoted to her.

Astrology: The Moon
The Moon is a nocturnal, cold, changeable, moist, receptive, and feminine planet. The fourth sign of the Zodiac, called Cancer or Katakam, is ruled by the Moon. This sign is just prior to the sign Leo, which is owned by the Sun. In Hindu Mythology, it is said that the Moon loves Rohini most, and it is exalted in Taurus, or Rishaba, which contains the Rohini star. The Moon moves around 13 degrees on average each day, and is very strong when it passes through Taurus. It is very weak and debilitated when it transits in the sign Scorpio, or Vrischika.

The Moon governs impregnation, conception, the birth of a child, animal instinct, union, and the embryo. It also rules the infant stage of a person, and has a powerful influence on their life. An afflicted Moon at the time of birth can cause frequent ailments and prevent proper growth. It can cause stomach upset and frequent vomiting, which reduces vitality. The effect of the Moon depends on the relative disposition of other planets, the aspects it receives, and the sign it occupies at the time of one's birth.

The Moon is a cold planet, and an afflicted Moon can often cause colds and fevers. Its characteristic is changeability, so its influence is often unsettling. If one is in service, they may have a desire for frequent changes. They may not stay in the same premises, and may change their residence frequently. Even in their room, they may be constantly rearranging their books and changing the position of furniture, curtains, and tables. Unless Saturn forms a favourable aspect, they cannot be steady. Just as the Moon appears different on different days, people born with the Moon as their ruling planet will be unsettled, wavering, and vacillating.

The Moon, representing the mother and owning the fourth house, indicates that the person will love their country and home. They will be attached to their mother and devoted to her.

Moon is known as Mathi, the mind. Mercury governs intelligence, and good aspects between Moon and Mercury give the native a fertile imagination, deep feelings, and emotion. Adverse aspects, however, offer indecision, lack of mental balance, a desire to lie and spread false rumours, and suffering from over-anxiety.

Moon, receiving good aspect from Venus, develops in the native a taste for music, art, painting, and scented, as well as a keen imagination and love for all pleasurable pursuits. Evil aspects, however, portend inconstancy with lady friends and female relatives. Excesses can cause digestive troubles.

Moon and Mars, when favourably disposed, offer extreme liberality and a frank nature. The native will be bold and inclined to make frequent journeys which will prove to be profitable. Adverse aspects, however, indicate that the person will be impulsive, rash, and reckless, and will develop strong attractions to the opposite sex, causing ill health and bringing ill reputation. These two planets also govern the monthly course of the ladies. Good aspects are fruitful, but evil aspects cause much pain and other troubles connected with menstruation.

Jupiter and Moon in favourable aspects give magnanimous ideas, a hopeful disposition, good imagination, and optimism. But if the aspects are bad, the native will be reckless and extravagant.

Saturn with its beneficial rays to Moon makes one patient, persistent, steady, cautious, and ever inclined to hoard money. The native will be able to concentrate. Unfavourable aspects, however, depress them and make them funky; there will be fear complex, inferiority complex, and pessimism. They cannot concentrate or meditate.

Uranus and Moon will develop in the native a taste for hypnotism, mesmerism, occultism, astrology, etc., and will make them independent. Adverse aspects, however, portend eccentricity. The native will be perverted and very hasty.

Neptune and Moon will make one proficient in fine arts, instrumental music, occultism, spiritualism, etc. Adverse aspects, however, threaten them with neurasthenic complaints, hysteria, insanity, incoherence in thought and speech, and create in them immoral and perverse sexual desires. Thus, Moon influences the brain, indicating our reaction for every result we have for the efforts we make. As Moon governs water, the native will have the desire to cross the sea, make long journeys, etc.

Moon also governs the stomach and the breasts of ladies. Good digestion or otherwise, beauty of the breasts, and her ability to feed her own child with breast milk or not, depend on the aspects which Moon receives. Mercury and Sun forming good aspect give proper digestion and assimilation. Saturn aspecting Moon gives very small breasts, Jupiter makes them very big, Venus adds beauty to them, and Mars keeps them strong and attractive.

Sun indicates the native's public life, holding high positions with authority and power. But Moon denotes family life, the home, and personal and private affairs. It also shows the multitude and the masses. Moon is considered to govern 'AP' or water power, denoting wells, ponds, tanks, rivers, fresh water, bays, and oceans. Hence, it is concerned with liquids, aquatic animals, and objects found under water, like pearls.

Parts of the Body Governed by the Moon: The left eye of males and the right eye of females, the breasts, stomach, esophagus, uterus, ovaries, synovial fluid, lymphatic vessels, sympathetic nerves, and bladder, etc.

Eye Diseases, Lunacy, Paralysis, Hysteria, Epilepsy, Dropsy, Bery-Bery, Myxodema, Colds, Coughs, Colic Pains, Worms, Intestinal Defects and Diseases, Catamenial Disorders, Tumours, Peritonitis, Uremia, Throat Troubles, Asthma, Eosonophilia, Bronchitis, Varicose Veins, Complications Due to Excess of Drinks, Hydrocele, Dyspepsia, Dysentery, Sprue, Nervous Debility, Gastric Catarrh, Cancer, Typhoid, etc.

Profession
Being a watery planet, the native may be employed in the shipping department, navy, water analysis, or water-supply department. He may deal in salt, fish, corals, pearls, perfumes, flowers, liquids, kerosene, petrol, milk, and boilers. Farmers, vegetable and fruit growers, and suppliers or dealers in such commodities are also governed by the Moon. Nurses, cooks, stall managers, launderers, and other occupations are also ruled by the Moon.

One may be a mechanical engineer in water-works, or if the Moon were to be in a movable or common sign, they may be a captain in a steamer or ship. If the Moon and Mars form good aspects and either is in Scorpio, they may deal with boilers. Venus forming an aspect denotes a dealer in parboiled rice, as Venus represents food. An aspect from Venus to the Moon alone shows that the native will be a dealer in milk products. If Saturn also aspects, they may deal in materials found at the bottom of the sea, such as conch-shells. Mars, Moon, and Sun indicate dealings in salt. Mars, Moon, and Venus govern aerated waters. Moon, Sun, and Venus indicate nursing, and if Jupiter is also connected with them, it indicates midwifery. Jupiter, Mercury, and Moon denote novel writings, as well as those who inspect accounts and internal auditors. Moon in the third house connected with the lord of profession indicates good salesmen and street hawkers. Thus, the modification of other planets will help in selecting one of the many indications of the Moon.

Products: Oranges, melons, cucumbers, palms, plantains, poppies, fruits, vegetables, ghee, curd, milk, cows, sugar, sugarcane, saffron, betel leaves, maize, nickel, silver, silverware, camphor, alum, horses, fish, aquatic animals, and cooked food.

Handwriting: As the moon is ever-changing, the native will write the same words and letters in different ways and shapes. The native may even make spelling mistakes when writing simple words, and may write a few words starting to the right and a few upright. If the native writes a letter when in a happy mood, they may draw wavy lines below their signature, resulting in an unsteady handwriting.

## Mars - The Brother
Astronomy: Mars is one of the outer planets, located nearer to the Earth than any of the other planets such as Jupiter or Saturn. The mean distance between the Sun and the Earth is approximately 93 million miles, while the mean distance between the Sun and Mars is 141 million miles. Both Earth and Mars orbit the Sun at different velocities, with Mars always outside the circle traced by the Earth.

To illustrate this concept, imagine two cows tied up to one post with ropes 93 yards and 141 yards long. They go round the post, making concentric circles with 93 and 141 yards as the radii. The cow tied up with the longer rope will make a bigger round than the other and will always be outside the circle described by the other cow with 93 yards rope. Similarly, Mars makes a bigger circle than that of the Earth and is always outside the circle formed by the Earth. Only the Moon, Mercury, and Venus can appear between the Earth and the Sun on certain occasions, while Mars, Jupiter, and other outer planets can never travel between the Sun and the Earth and are always outside.

Mars completes its journey round the Sun in 687 days, making a Martian year 687 of our solar days. Mars is smaller than the Earth, with a diameter of approximately 4,200 miles, which is double that of the Moon. The mass of Mars is a little above one tenth of that of the Earth. It is found that Mars rotates about itself in 24 hours 37 minutes 23 seconds in the same direction as that of the Earth. A Martian Sidereal Day is roughly 1,026 of our solar days. Mars closely resembles the Earth in one aspect; that is, the axis, about which it rotates, is tilted up at an angle of 24 degrees 50 minutes. Just like the Earth, Mars has temperate and frigid zones.

Mars is red in colour and so its light is ruddy in appearance. It shines in the night so very brilliantly that it is easily distinguishable from other stars and planets. Mars is not clearly visible both in the early morning and in the evening immediately after sunset when it is nearer to the Sun. However, when the longitude between the Sun and Mars increases, the latter shines more brilliantly than the brightest of the stars (Sirius).
Mars is the brother of Earth.

Mythology: Mars

Mars is said to be the deity of the Buddhists and the God of the Romans. It is the God of war and also of hunting. Mars (or Ares in Greek; Artes in Egyptian; Angaraka, Mangala, Kuja in Sanskrit and Savvai in Tamil) is the son of Jupiter (Zeus) and his wife Hera. He is the God of dispute, destruction, and war and was disliked by one and all because of his warlike nature. Many a time, other Gods wounded him and conquered him. Once he was imprisoned by his conqueror, but Mercury came to his relief and freed him. He loved Venus who reciprocated satisfactorily. Mars was held in high esteem and honor in the Roman Empire. In the Bible, Mars is symbolized by the Devil. It is the God of force and energy. According to the Hindus, Mars is God Muruga, Subramanya, Kumaraswamy, Velayudham, or Vadivel, meaning the fighting power. He is considered to be the Commander-in-Chief of the celestial armies. Mars rules over "Sama Veda".

Mars ruled the first month of the Roman Year, March, and the eighth month of the Roman Year, October. Certain days in those months were given over to Martian ceremonies. Until the time of Augustus, Mars had only two temples at Rome; both were connected to military operations. One of the temples was an altar, while the other was the gate through which the army used to march.

Astrology: Mars is a dry, fiery planet, masculine in nature. It rules Aries and Scorpio, is exalted in Capricorn, debilitated in Cancer, and determined in Taurus and Libra. Mars is associated with energy, both constructive and destructive, depending on its position, aspects, and location in the horoscope. Mars has much to do with one's ambition and desires. It symbolizes the senses and rules over the animal instinct in humans. Generally, Mars is considered a malefic planet. If it is not afflicted and receives favorable aspects, it can offer qualities such as self-confidence, endurance, impulse for ventures, strength, courage, combativeness, sharp wit, the ability to argue, a go-ahead spirit, quick mental activity, extraordinary muscular strength, great organizing ability, power for practical execution, independent spirit, force of character, strong determination, ambition, and leadership.

If one is intelligent and sensible, they will not oppose a Martian, as they will select the opportune moment to strike and withdraw. It is always advisable to make all efforts to enter into compromise with Martians instead of widening the gap and inviting further trouble. Martians can combine physical delight and spiritual well-being when they live on a higher plane of consciousness.

If Mars is weak and afflicted in a horoscope, the native will be rash, lose their temper quickly, and be foolhardy. As Mars rules over contentions and strifes, they will be quarrelsome. If Mars is afflicted and weak, all the good qualities mentioned above will be absent, and they will submit to others. They may be fond of drink. Whenever there is any difference of opinion, they will rely more on the application of brute force than to argue intelligently and try to convince logically. They will not hesitate to take the aggressive part.

Mostly, the worst type of sexualities is governed by Mars. Such people will satisfy their sexual hunger in novel ways, not minding the pain they give to their partners. They may adopt malpractices. Martians are said to be extremists. If they are true to anyone, they will go to any extent, even at the risk of their lives, to save their friends. They will sacrifice anything.

Beneficial Mars makes the natives adventurous and independent. They do not relish suggestions from others, but they will act according to their own conscience. They dislike small undertakings, but prefer to execute large projects. Many pioneers, leaders, heroes, warriors, and explorers are the sons of Mars. "Mars is the chief governor for brother and landed property."

Physical Features: People born with Mars as their ruling planet will have a white complexion with a shade of red. They will be tall and muscular, with pimples on their face and round eyes. Their waists will be narrow and their bones will be full of red bone marrow.

Aspects with Other Planets: Mars forming a good aspect with the Sun makes the body of the native hot and susceptible to sharp and acute complaints such as smallpox and high fever. A good aspect between these two planets gives abundant energy and good health, as well as immunity and resistance against infectious diseases. Both planets give courage, frankness, and enthusiasm, making the native self-made and lucky. If they form a bad aspect, the native is liable to suffer from fever, accidents, wounds, explosions, etc. There will be unnecessary disputes, excitement, and difficulties due to rash actions, as well as an unpleasant and unhappy domestic life. The native will get easily irritated and become violent, and will be worried.

Mars forming a good aspect with the Moon indicates that the native will be very generous, ambitious, bold, and enthusiastic. Robust health, especially for ladies (as both planets govern the menstrual periods), a strong constitution, and good appearance are given by Mars. Evil aspects between these two planets threaten the native with rash and impulsive action. He may be reckless and go to extremes without considering the consequences. Both health and reputation will suffer, and accidents will be frequent, with the possibility of profuse bleeding. Beneficial aspects promise an improvement in status and satisfactory financial success. Adverse aspects portend losses, slander, the end of life for any near and dear relative, misunderstandings, silly quarrels, and irritation.

If Mars receives good aspects from Mercury, one will demonstrate a love for work; they will quickly complete all the duties assigned to them. This aspect offers vitality, vigor, and valor. Promotion, prosperity, success in competition and disputes, a bright outlook on life, and an adventurous spirit are indicated by the beneficial aspects between Mars and Mercury. Adverse aspects will make the native a cheat, a scoundrel, and a thief. Additionally, the native themselves may lose by theft. They may be swindled by others.

Good Aspect from Jupiter to Mars Shows Success

The good aspect from Jupiter to Mars shows that the native will be determined, exercising free will with a go-ahead spirit. He will be noble and succeed in competitive examinations, gaining financial success. Logicians and lawyers will have the favourable aspect between Mars and Jupiter, as will bank agents and political leaders, who will have strong and beneficial aspects between these two planets.

Adverse Aspect between Jupiter and Mars Causes Loss

Adverse aspect between these two planets causes extravagant expense, loss through litigation, loss through investment in banks or through gambling. There may also be criminal proceedings and prosecutions, as well as de-promotion or transfer to undesirable localities or sections.

Good Aspect between Venus and Mars

A good aspect between Venus and Mars is indeed very beneficial, as the peaceful and passionate Venus will soften and tone down the fiery nature of Mars, making the native courteous, upright, accommodating, and diplomatic. He will try to lead a peaceful and harmonious life. Occasionally, the amorous nature of the native will overcome and conquer his free-will and independent spirit. He will be fond of sports and pleasurable pursuits. Courage, confidence, and capability to do business will help him to amass wealth and possess landed properties with gardens, etc. He may spend to his entire satisfaction and enjoy his life a good deal, forming fortunate attachments with the ladies and gaining popularity.

Bad Aspect between Mars and Venus

A bad aspect between Mars and Venus can make one lavish, reckless, extravagant, and unmindful of any loss that he may incur. To satisfy his lust and desire, he will do anything and mingle himself with low-class women or low-paid servants. A few will even go to the extent of borrowing from low-class people and squandering everything. If one were to exercise his or her strong will, one can avoid these troubles, unlike those caused by the evil aspect between Jupiter and Saturn or Jupiter and Uranus. These evil results are the outcome of one's own mean actions, so one should try to avoid troubles, ill-repute, slander, disgrace, domestic unhappiness, etc., and the dirty venereal diseases, by exercising his or her strong will, determination, and action.

Favorable Aspects between Saturn and Mars

Favorable aspects between Saturn and Mars are very beneficial, as Saturn does not allow one to be impulsive, rash, and aggressive. Instead, it regulates, makes one bold and courageous, and gives the native force or character. Patience, endurance, health, and activity with enthusiasm and executive ability will reward the native amply and offer good rise in life to occupy covetable posts. He never shrinks from work, nor has any stage-fear. Even if he has to face many difficulties due to other combinations, he will go through the ordeal successfully.

Adverse Aspects

Adverse aspects are, in some cases, very dangerous. Both are malefic by nature and if they also own evil houses, one has to exercise care during the joint periods of these two planets or during such periods, when they form aspects either by transit or by progression. One will be rash, get quickly irritated, become uncontrollable, be hasty, and even commit murder. We have heard of cold murders without any previous contemplation and planning but committed suddenly on any provocation followed by immediate surrender to the police authorities. Without exception, we can see the evil aspects in the horoscopes of these criminals. Mars represents sharp instruments, knife, gun, etc., whereas Saturn is the chief governor for longevity; both represent one's end of life. To ruin oneself by squandering away permanent possessions, to lose temporary possessions by theft, and to lose one's charm by suffering from smallpox, etc., are attributed to the evil aspects between Mars and Saturn.

Beneficial Aspects between Mars and Uranus
The native will be resourceful, original, and independent, with intuition and interest in occult subjects. Discovering or inventing this beneficial aspect can be very helpful, as it will allow the native to translate their latent ingenuity and abilities into action, whenever these two planets form favourable aspects either by transit or by progression.

Bad Aspects between Saturn and Mars
The native will become easily angered and, when provoked further, cannot be controlled. Perversion, eccentricity, and doggedness will prevent them from paying heed to other’s suggestions, and they will carry on in their own line of action. They may become stonehearted and wicked, and will fight to the last to establish that they are right, regardless of any material gain. They will stick to their own ideas, even in the face of loss, and will start any business in a flash, which will often end in a crash, followed by disgrace and slander.

Good Aspects of Neptune Make the Native Religious
Success to a satisfactory extent and jubilant spirit are promised. Neptune may make the native take long journeys, have contact with foreigners, have foreign collaboration, and gain much profit in wholesale business, agency, etc.

Bad Aspects Make the Native Perverted in Sexual Life and Frenzied in Religion or Philosophy
The native may have a tendency to poison others or to commit suicide by drowning or taking poison. Otherwise, they may run the risk of being drowned in the sea, river, lake, or well.

Thus, the characteristics of the native are modified by the various aspects received by Mars from the other planets.

Parts of the Body: Mars Governs
Mars governs the external sex organs, muscular system, left ear, face and head, sense of taste, the bladder, nose, uterus, pelvis of kidney, prostate gland, groins, rectum, the colon, the testicles, and red bone marrow.

Disease from which one Suffers when one Runs the Period of Mars
When one runs the period of Mars, who, by its lordship or by occupation, becomes evil, one may suffer from any of the following acute fevers, plague, smallpox, chicken pox, measles, mumps, inflammatory complaints, burns, ruptures of capillaries, fistula, wounds, cuts, brain fever, haemorrhage, typhoid, pueperal fever, ulcer in the intestines, hernia, erysipelas, malaria, abortions, bleeding, boils, carbuncles, appendicites, muscular rheumatism, tumour, septic poisoning, tetanus, etc. To accurately diagnose the aliment and determine its nature requires further deep study, thorough analysis, and correct judgment. Astrology can be useful to the doctor and patient if they are forewarned in advance, as they can take precautionary measures (prophylactic, vaccines, etc.) to protect themselves completely or reduce the virulence of the disease, if it is inevitable to suffer from it.

Profession
As Mars gives one courage and is a militant planet, one may be employed in the military department. Police is also governed by Mars. Those who deal with guns, hunters and gunners may have Mars as the lord of the 2nd, 6th or the 10th house, or Mars may occupy or aspect these houses, or be conjoined with the lords of those houses. Chemists, dentists, surgeons, butchers and barbers are governed by Mars. Those who deal in iron and steel, in the kitchen, in the boilers, steam engines, etc., are under the rule of Mars. It also indicates the smiths industry, factory, dealers in corals, ruby, red articles, thief, robber, dacoit, murder, etc. Mars in the fiery signs shows that one may go to the war front and fight. In earthy signs, it indicates infantry. Mars occupying airy sign denotes air pilots. Watery sign occupied by Mars indicates navy. So also, planets conjoined with Mars or aspecting Mars give clues to find out the exact nature of one's profession. Sun conjoined with Mars indicates that one may be in the accounts or audit department, as Mercury stands for inspection of accounts; military or mechanical engineering is also governed by Mars and Mercury. Venus rules over transport. Saturn indicates that one may be employed in digging trenches, graves, etc., and also to carry the wounded as well as to dispose of the dead.

Products
Iron and steel, coffee, tea, cholam, shellac, tobacco, hemp, walnut, cashew nut, groundnut, betel nut, ginger, pine, mustards, nux vomica, gentiane, garlic, brandy, whisky, arrack, toddy, bhaspum (powders), metallic oxides, pungent articles, axe, knife, sword, gun, etc., copper, wrapon called sataghni, landed properties, serpent, thorny plants, land, building, old materials, old instruments for repairs, and renewal. Mars and Saturn denote iron and steel; Mars and Venus show coffee, tea, etc. Mars and Neptune indicate tobacco; Mars and Moon rule over brandy, whisky, etc. Mars and Rahu or Kethu suggest serpents.

Political: Differences of opinion, disputes, difficulties, misunderstandings, and quarrels among leaders can lead to preparation for war and fighting in the battlefield, restlessness in the state, revolution, violence, murder, rape, loot, bloodshed, arson, kidnapping, etc. Cordite factories manufacture arms and ammunition, bombs, fireworks, tanks, weapons, acids, etc. Reorganisation or expansion of industries producing chemicals, fertilisers, tractors, jeeps, arms, and other death-inflicting weapons, as well as nationalisation of such industries, can lead to drastic laws and reforms, martial law and ordinances, expropriation of foreign capital, expansion of agriculture, reclamation of wastelands, marshy lands, etc. The production and movement of these items can be controlled and restricted by Mars.

Economic: Whenever Mars forms beneficial aspects, there will be great activity and new ventures will be undertaken. In the market, there will be brisk buying and selling, and new companies will be floated. Good aspects at the time of the registration of the company show that it will be sound and profitable, while bad aspects forewarn that the relationship among the directors will not be cordial, leading to misunderstandings and difficulties. Manufacture of motors, engines, spare parts of machines, tools, etc., and the export and import of these are ruled by Mars, as it is called the Boomi Karaka and is a fiery planet. Manufacture of brick, construction of buildings, and quarters for officials and servants are also ruled by Mars. 

Being an impulsive and rash planet, the prices of shares will suddenly have a sharp rise or, if Mars is afflicted by Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune, a precipitous fall. Good aspects give courage to bulls and bad aspects depress them, but give a go-ahead spirit to the bears. There will be strikes by krisans, technicians, mechanics, and subordinates, and as a result, agriculture and industry will be affected. Jupiter and Venus afflicting Mars threaten the cultivators with loss and disappointment, as the agriculture produce will be affected by locusts, pests, rats, etc. There will be an increase in taxes to launch new projects due to war preparations and stockpiling. Purchases of fire engines, expansion of fire extinguishing departments, expansion of vigilance, and A.R.P. are also governed by Mars.

Handwriting: Mars gives sharp angles and narrow hooks. The upper zone is short while the lower zone is long and strong. His words invariably slant towards the right, though very rarely he writes upright. The strokes of his words are thick. He separates his words lavishly, wasting much paper, but not much time. He finds that putting a dot over "i" and drawing a horizontal stroke for "t" are a waste of time. He boldly underlines his signature, which ascends from left to right.

Animals and Birds: Savage Beasts (Tiger, Wolf, Hunting Dogs, etc.), Elephant (according to Brihat Samhita), Vulture, Kite, Hawk, etc.

Plants: Thorny plants, gentian, garlic, marjoram, mustard, hemp, coriander, tobacco, and pine.

Places in India
Mars presides over Narmada, Bheemaratha, Nivindhya, Vetravatee, Godavari, Vena, Ganges, Mahanadhee, Sindhu, Uttara Pandya, near Mount Mahendra, Vindhya, Malaya, Chola, Dravida, Videha, Andhra, Kerala, Asmaka, Bhasapara Kuntalai, Cantipura, Nassik, Bhogavardhana, Tupte, Gomptee, etc.

Places: Warfields, Military Areas, Slaughterhouses, Police Stations, Industrial Areas, Smith Shops, etc.

Time: The two months governed by Mars are referred to as Grisham Ruthu, which are June and July.

Days: Mars Rules Tuesdays
Sundays and Mondays will prove to be days of success, pleasure, and profit. Fridays show pleasure, union, and expense. Wednesdays affect health but increase one's income and improve one's business, and give frequent short journeys. Thursdays are for investment, expansion, and long journeys. Saturdays will be dull and lethargic.

Number: Nine is the number of Mars. One, two, four, and seven are considered auspicious. Three indicates a journey and pleasant purchases. Five is lucky, but health may deteriorate. Six indicates pleasure and expenses. Eight threatens that the native will be lazy and only enjoy success when they become dejected.

Colour: Red is Ruled by Mars

If one is very impulsive or rash, they can use blue so that they can exercise caution and avoid injuries. When selecting a colour, it is important to note the weak points of the native for corrections and improvement. If Mars is very strong and is in a fiery or airy sign, they will be very bold and even rash. For such people, green and blue are the best colours to cool them down and keep them under control. They will not be rash but they will have enthusiasm and practical executive ability.

If Mars indicates one's disease, the astrologer must consider the nature of the ailment and suggest the colour accordingly. If Mars and Moon cause smallpox, red colour should be used for the panes, glass doors, screen cloth, etc. so that the patient will have a rapid cure and they will not appear pox-faced as no scars and pits will be formed due to exposure to red colour. But if Mars and Mercury cause excitement, insanity, or fits, blue and green should be used when they come to normal.

But if one is gloomy, dull, lethargic, and lazy, red should be used; inferiority complex will disappear. They will make fresh attempts and come out successful, even though they had been suffering for a long period due to delay or denial. Red colour offers authority and power; it is useful to overcome dangers and avoid accidents. This is why police stations are red, policemen are supplied with red caps, and fire engines have red paint. Red signals stop one from further proceeding in the same direction at that time, to avoid collision, derailment, and accidents.

All these show that red colour is used to avoid danger, to run no risk, to maintain law and order, and to lead a happy life.

Gems: Coral, Ruby, and All Red Stones Governed by Mars
If one desires to avoid injuries, cuts, burns, scalds, abrasions, to become bold and independent, and to succeed in competition, litigation, etc., they can use red stones.

Prayers: To Ward Off the Evil Indicated by Mars and to Enjoy Beneficial Results
One should pray to the following gods:
(1) If Mars is not connected with any planet, Lord Muruga Subramanya.
(2) If connected with Sun, Veerabhadra; Surya Namaskaram.
(3) If conjoined with Moon, Kali, Parvathi, Lalitha.
(4) If in any manner connected with Mercury, Narasimha Veeraraghava.
(5) Mars, Mercury and Venus, Lakshmi Narasimha.

(12) Mars and Kethu, Lord Ganesh.
(13) Mars, Venus and Kethu, Vallabha Ganapati.
(14) Saturn, Mars, Venus and Kethu, Uchista Maha Ganapathi and so on..

Advice to Ladies
It is advantageous for ladies to wear red stones, put on red kukum, and use red clothes, etc., because Mars is believed to protect them from the time of birth until the end of life at every stage. For example, in infancy, this protection can help them to have resistance against diseases, not suffer from liver complaints, put on weight, avoid burns, and not dip their hands in boiling milk. In youth, Mars can help them to avoid fire accidents, such as when lighting crackers or standing near stoves. Additionally, Mars can help them to have proper menstruation and not suffer from pains in the breasts or belly. It can also help them to be free from Mars dhosha and have a pleasing partner, and have their marriage celebrated in the proper age without undue delay. Furthermore, Mars can help them to avoid abortions, bleeding, and the need for a surgeon's aid during delivery, as well as to own lands and a house. Additionally, Mars can help them to avoid accidents while going by car or scooter. It can also help them to have a good understanding with their brothers, who can provide help and support, and to be respected by others. Finally, Mars can help them to have no fears and be courageous to maintain health and be ever active until the end of life.

Therefore, ladies should fast on Tuesdays and pray for that deity above. They are recommended to use red gems, cloths, etc., which will give them mental solace. They can be confident that there is no more evil ruled by Mars, etc.

## Mercury: THE UNCLE

Astronomy: Mercury - The Dualist
Sun has Mercury as its closest neighbor, even as the Earth has the Moon; Mercury is bigger than the Moon, but smaller than the Earth. It is an average of about 36 million miles away from the Sun. The distance varies between 29 million miles and 43 million miles. This is due to the fact that the orbit of Mercury is eccentric and much elongated. It revolves around the Sun in 88 days. Its diameter is nearly 3,200 miles. As the size of Mercury is very small, and its mass is very little, its gravitational pull is naturally very weak.

There is no atmosphere around it. As Mercury is very near the Sun, and the Earth is also revolving around the Sun, there will be occasions when we can note this tiny planet, Mercury, transiting between the Sun and the Earth, and it will be seen in the disc of the Sun. It will appear as a black sharp disc. No ring of light will be visible, which is evidence that there is no atmosphere. If there were to be any atmosphere, the Sun's rays would pass through it and due to refraction it would form a ring around Mercury. As there is no atmosphere, no animal can exist.

Further, one half of Mercury will always be very hot and it will be around 360 degrees centigrade; and the other half will be very cold, much cooler than our Arctic regions during severe winter. Mercury takes as much time to revolve about itself once on its axis as it takes to go once around the Sun. Hence one half of Mercury will always receive the rays of light and heat from the Sun, whereas the other half will always remain in night without having the chance to see the Sun at all. Thus, that half of Mercury facing the Sun is always hot and the other half is always cold. Even though Mercury is about 36 million miles away from the Sun, it is not easy to see Mercury with the naked eye as it will always be very near the Sun and the maximum longitudinal distance between the Sun and it will be 28 degrees. Its speed is 95,000 miles per hour.

Mythology: In olden days, it was known as Thoth or Hermes. It is the son of Jupiter and Maia, the daughter of Atlas. He is said to be the friend of Apollo, probably because it is in the closest vicinity to the Sun. Mercury is called a youth flying with wings at his heels, bearing a caduceus made of olive wood about which were entwined two serpents, the rod being surmounted with a pair of wings. Indeed, this symbol represents speed, wisdom, and duality. Mercury is the inventor of the lyre. He is the god of commerce or gold, eloquence, and always exhibits duality and lacks concentration. Though Mercury is the intellectual planet, he is called a convertible and mutable planet and Mercurians will generally possess a will-o'-the-wisp character.

Hindus regard Mercury as representing gods Kesava, Narayana, Madhava, etc. He represents Dwaitham, whereas Saturn denotes Advaitham, as Mercury is for plurality while Saturn is for the single one. If one wants to propitiate a god and if the person has the following combinations in his horoscope or if Mercury has any connection with other planets by occupying their sign, etc., he has to make a judicious choice and cultivate steady habits, concentrate, and meditate properly, as Mercury denotes vacillation and lack of concentration.

Mercury rules the Atharvana Veda. He governs Sarat Ruthu (October and November). The following combinations are to be taken into consideration and proper initiation is necessary to have peace and prosperity:

Mercury --- Vishnu 
Mercury and Sun --- Suryanarayana 
Mercury and Moon --- Goddess Saraswathi 
Mercury and Mars --- Narasimha, Veera Raghava 
Mercury and Jupiter --- Bhadrinarayana 
Mercury and Venus --- Laxmi Narayana 
Mercury and Saturn --- Anjaneya
Mercury, Saturn and Venus --- Krishna 
Mercury, Venus and Mars --- Lakshmi Narasimha 
Mercury, Mars and Saturn --- Venkateswara
Mercury, Moon and Saturn --- Renganatha
Mercury, Moon and Jupiter --- Rama (Sundarakandam)
Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn --- Geetha Parayanam and will be a great liar.

Astrology: Mercury is a variable, convertible, vacillating, feminine, effeminate, neutral, and dualistic planet. Just as a messenger has to carry out the orders of others and act on their behalf, so also Mercury will not act independently but expresses a nature in accordance with the nature of the planet with which he is conjoined or from which he receives aspects. He is called convertible because he will prove to be a benefic to those in whose horoscopes Mercury is conjoined with or aspected by benefics, whereas he becomes a malefic if he is in any way connected with evil planets. He rules Gemini and Virgo. Mercury gets exalted in Virgo and is very weak and debilitated in Pisces (Meena). His friends are Saturn and Venus, whereas his enemies are Sun, Moon, Mars, and Jupiter.

Mercury shows the type of mentality one is endowed with, as he governs the reaction to one's senses and impressions. He rules over the solar plexus and the central nervous system. Being an intellectual planet, the Mercurian is highly intelligent, ingenious, and analytical. He will grasp subjects very quickly. He gives the native retentive power and reproductive ability. Mercury with good aspects represents a subtle political brain and intellect, and an excellent disputant, a logician with learning, and discretion. He makes one a researcher into mysteries and learning, sharp and witty, learning almost anything without a teacher, and ambitious of being exquisite in every science. Mercury gives one the desire to make frequent short travels and see foreign places. He gives curiosity to master occult science also. The greatest drawback is that he does not allow one to be steady enough to complete a project. Therefore, a Mercurian has to exercise his will and follow up any undertaking since, at each stage, his attention will be drawn to other matters, with the result that nothing will ever get completed, unless and until he has exercised perseverance and steadiness. Restlessness and variability are Mercury's characteristics.

Mercury, when afflicted by other planets, makes the person frenetic. He will be a clever, cunning, and mischievous anonymous petition-writer. His tongue and pen will ever be against those whom he does not like. He will turn out to be a great gambler, the worst liar, a conceited, showy person, with vain-glorious statements extolling himself, or a prattler talking in a childish and artless fashion. Such an afflicted Mercurian will be a cheat or be ever busy carrying tales and uttering falsehood, mostly forgetting what he had already said. Further, he will neither stick to one place nor to one opinion. He is termed "Lotamama" as he will side with one party when he finds some advantage there and on the same day he will change his coat, join the opponent, and advocate the latter's cause. He will pretend as though he knows everything, whereas actually he is void of real learning. He will be a talkative person, perverted, eccentric, unprincipled, inconstant, and boastful. He will worry himself by being hasty. He will commit mistakes due to forgetfulness. He is a man of moods and will be a great liar.

The Effects of Mercury in Dignity and Receiving Favourable Aspects

Mercury in dignity and receiving favourable aspects makes one versatile, good in mathematical calculations, engineering, accounts, and correspondence. They have a keen intuition and ability, but the tendency to allow their attention to wander can stand in the way of their grand success. However, if they take up things seriously, they will be "quick on the trigger" and work rapidly and accurately, coming out successful in all their enterprises.

Mercury is a talkative planet, so persons ruled by Mercury will prove to be good salesmen, insurance agents, publicity officials, propagandists, orators, and eloquent and fast speakers with ready wit, and they will be capable of learning many languages (the language depends on the other connections which Mercury has). If Mercury is afflicted in one's chart, generally the native may commit a blunder during the previous Saturn period which will be talked about by the general public during the Mercury period, bringing scandal and ill-repute to the native.

As Mercury governs the green colour, the choice during Mercury's period will be mostly green. Mercury indicating the north direction shows that the person, during Mercury's period, will have to move towards the north direction. If Mercury is a benefic, the native will make their fortune in the north, and if Mercury is a malefic, they will go to the north and suffer. Mercury's number is five, so during Mercury's periods, they will own a car whose numerology is 5; if they shift their residence, they will occupy a house whose numerological number is 5 (14;23;3241;50 and so on). Even when they engage a taxi, the number will be five. Thus the planets will work. Good results or adverse ones depend on the beneficial or adverse aspect which Mercury receives. Mercury is the chief governor for education and uncle.

Physical Features
Usually, he will be tall with a well-formed body. He may be stout, but will usually be of average height. His hands will be long and slender, and his hair will be dark. His eyes will be expressive, and his eyebrows will be curved with much hair. His voice will be thin and shrill; if afflicted, he will stammer. He will walk very quickly, and will appear younger than his actual age.

Aspects with Other Planets
Mercury cannot form any major aspect according to the Western system, as it can never be more than 28 degrees from the Sun. Mercury can be both in advance of the Sun and also behind the Sun. If it rises before the Sun and is in advance, the native cannot be as intelligent as the one born with Mercury rising after the Sun; that is, the longitude of Mercury will then be less than that of the Sun. However, the conjunction of the Sun and Mercury in the same house will give the native resourcefulness, shrewdness, adaptability, and an adjusting temperament. He will have the capacity to create pleasure in any surrounding or environment, as well as under all circumstances.

There is a difference of opinion in estimating the strength of Mercury if it is within the orb of 17 degrees. Some say that Mercury loses its power, but others opine that it does not lose its strength. Many great people have the Sun and Mercury close to each other, with Mercury being within 3 degrees from the Sun. Chief Engineers, Accountant Generals, and Publicity officials have the Sun and Mercury in close proximity, and they have their promotion in Mercury period and Sun sub-period, showing that the Sun and Mercury have produced very intelligent people and that they enjoyed very good prospects during their joint periods. The Sun and Mercury will offer much literary success, an inclination to study Astrology, Astronomy, Engineering, and Mathematics. The person will be ambitious, intuitive, intelligent, quick-witted, thoughtful, studious, capable, and aspiring. He will learn business tactics easily. The aspects which can be formed are conjunction, vigintile, quindecile, parallel, and within 2 degrees from semi-sextile.
 Sun is Karaka for medicine).

Moon and Mercury: Good Aspect of Moon and Mercury shows that the person will be quick in wit and reasonable, have a fertile imagination and fluent expression, and be able to learn many languages easily. They will have original ideas and enjoy frequent changes and short journeys, and never be pessimistic. As age advances, imagination and intuition will increase, and they will develop any art with some competence therein. Moon gives success in correspondence, advertising, conversation, etc. If the aspects are adverse, they will be worried, anxious, and confused with a sarcastic state of mind. Moon makes one indecisive, speculative, and sensitive, with poor memory. Temporary upset through troubles in the nervous or digestive system, writing, signing, or entering into a wrong contract, public criticism, and loss in business are indicated. It is advisable for them not to stand surety to anybody, and dealings with close relatives will not be happy. Travels will bring in loss, so cautious action is necessary to avoid slander and fraud. It is not beneficial to change any house, especially when their joint period operates.

The results mentioned for each aspect will be experienced by the native whenever they run the joint periods of those planets according to the Ududasa system, and also whenever they form aspects by progression or by transit. The extent to which it will be enjoyed during progression is much greater than what one can have during transit.

Mars, forming good aspects with Mercury, shows that the native will be healthy, active, and alert, never lazy or lethargic. Quick turn-over of work, ability to organize original and novel ideas, and shortcut methods are offered jointly by Mars and Mercury. The native will always be working, as this aspect makes them lively, witty, humorous, ingenious, constructive, skilful, practical, and business-like. They will show a keen interest in work, do it with zeal, and exhibit their mental ability. They will have an inclination towards instrumental music, mechanical or ground engineering, carving, drawing, industry, factory, chemistry, and medicine (if the Sun also conjoins, as the Sun is the Karaka for medicine).

Venus stands for Vahana, meaning vehicle, or when Mercury or Mars is the lord of the fourth house. Mars and Mercury forming favourable aspects and occupying watery signs show that the person may be attached to boiler engines, the Navy, etc. In earthy signs, it indicates mechanical engineering and ground engineering. In airy signs, it denotes that the person will be attached to aircrafts, the electricity department, or one who surveys, designs, and prepares estimates. In fiery signs, it indicates that the person will be connected with industry, factories, etc. Mars forming an evil aspect with Mercury gives the subject great mental activity and intellectual power. He will be impulsive and rash, and will get irritated and order people around, and may even be violent. If Mercury or Mars has any connection with the significator of the partner in life, there will be disharmony and they may even manhandle each other. Colic pains, piles, and fissures are also indicated by these two planets.

Disputes, litigation, loss through theft, risky ventures, careless correspondence, hasty decisions leading to public scandal and criticism are threatened by bad aspects. While good aspects give the person the capacity to make their fortune in quick buying and selling, by being a broker or a jobber, bad aspects will give them courage and foolhardiness to speculate and lose. They will lose through fraud, cheating, and forgery, or they themselves will commit such crimes. If either of the two planets happens to be the lord of the sixth or twelfth house, they will be cheated. If either is the lord of the ascendant, they themselves will be a criminal.

Good Aspects between Mercury and Jupiter

Good aspects between Mercury and Jupiter give the native clear thinking, correct forethought, and good judgement. He will be prudent and wise, possessing a broad and philosophical mind. He will be versatile, constructive, creative, hopeful, optimistic, jovial, and contented. His disposition will be humane; he will be honest, law-abiding, God-fearing, religious-minded, and liberal. He will be fond of making religious and professional trips and will have inspirational ideas. He will be a good journalist, correspondent, copyist, writer, cashier, auditor, inspector, etc. If a person expects such a service, he can enter into any of these when he runs their joint periods or it may be one planet's sub-period and the other planet's sub-sub-period. When later he enjoys the dasa of either, he can be sure of his promotion and prosperity. If Mars also has any connection, one can become the agent of a bank, treasury collector, revenue officer, etc. He will be a good astrologer, always predicting good results and offering mental solace to the depressed.

Bad Aspects between Jupiter and Mercury

Bad aspects between Jupiter and Mercury show difficulties, obstacles, misfortune, bad investments, verbal agreements which will not be fulfilled, signing of contracts bringing loss, correspondence leading to litigation and troubles, quarrels with the preceptor, trouble in the assessment and payment of taxes, false reports, falsification of accounts, scandal, ill-repute, loss or accident during travel, etc. The health of the person will suffer due to excesses, frequent feasts, vitamin B deficiency, dyspepsia, lack of enzymes, etc. He may get into editing, publishing, journalism, religion, law, banking, insurance, investment, speculation, literature, commerce, accounts, administrative departments in engineering, treasury, income-tax, sales-tax, etc., and earn his livelihood. He should not overtrade. Sun and Venus on the other side.)

Mercury and Venus Forming Good Aspects Indicate the Native Will Be Cheerful and Mirthful

Mercury and Venus can never be as far away from the Sun as other planets; Mercury can be 28 degrees away from the Sun and Venus 48 degrees. There may be occasions when Mercury is on one side of the Sun and Venus is on the other side.

At one time, the Sun and Venus can be only 76 degrees apart. This creates the following aspects: vigintile, quindecile, semi-sextile, semi-quintile, semi-square, sextile, quintile, conjunction, and parallel. Except for the semi-square, all of these aspects are considered to be favorable and will likely offer desirable results.

The native with good aspects will have a hopeful, intuitive, good-tempered, sociable, friendly, amiable, and merry mind. They will enjoy recreation, fine arts, and refinement. They will also hate disputes and disharmony. Financially, this aspect promises gain of property and shares in flourishing companies, as well as a happy married life with a beautiful and intelligent wife. The native will also enjoy both social and financial success.

Mercury and Saturn Aspect

Mercury offers the native steadiness, carefulness, good judgement, precision, methodical approach to any subject, good memory, etc. If Mercury occupies or owns the 2nd, 7th or 11th house, it often denotes that the person will have two attachments at least and many partners in business. This aspect is essential for making money through mental accomplishments, such as writing comedies (Saturn for tragedies), speaking at clubs and societies, designing and laying out, pleasant journeys, arranging for picnic parties, travel agencies, clerks, cinema, drama advertisers, commerce, shipping, and transport (Watery sign occupied by them indicates shipping; airy sign shows air travel, dealing in antiques and curios). Further, they indicate that the person will make money through luxuries, beautiful or scented articles, painting, or through music, radio, transistor, gramophone, etc., jewellery, dress-making, confectionary, etc. They may also gain through children, wife and ladies.

If Saturn forms good aspects with Mercury, the native will have strong will, perseverance, patience, persistence and determination to fulfill their desires. They may have the aspiration to lead in politics and hold jobs in corporations, government and such companies where security of services is assured. They will thrive in such a business where caution, prudence and good judgement are required. Jupiter, lending its assistance by its good aspect, indicates that they can teach these subjects in school.

If the aspect between Saturn and Mercury is evil, all their efforts will be delayed; they may be disappointed and depressed. It may cause disharmony and dispute, and lead to debts and disease. Their education will be poor, memory poor, finance poor, health poor and retentive power absolutely absent. If they were to run their joint periods during school days, they will be spotted as the dullest student in the class.

## JUPITER-THE CHILDREN

Astronomy: Jupiter is Far Beyond the Swarm of Asteroids
Jupiter is nearly 500 million miles from the Sun and is the mighty planet known as the giant of the solar system. It has a diameter of 88,000 miles, nearly ten times the diameter of the Earth. The radius of the orbit by which Jupiter moves is around 143 million miles and it takes a little less than twelve years to go once round the Sun.

Even though the distance of Jupiter is so much, it appears in the sky as a bright object, brighter than all the other planets except Mars (Sevvai) and Venus (Sukra). On new moon days, when it is in opposition to both the luminaries, it shines brilliantly and casts a shadow. Jupiter is visible clearly to the naked eye, even when the Moon is in the sky.

Jupiter is round and flattened at the poles. It also rotates on its axis, just like Earth, but the period of rotation is not uniform as the upper parts of Jupiter are not completely solidified. It rotates very fast and completes one rotation in 10 minutes less than 10 hours. Jupiter has eleven moons, whereas Earth has only one and Mars has two. will have Venus as lord of 6 or lord of 8, and both the ownership are undesirable.

Mythology: Jupiter is considered to be the teacher. God Dhakshinamurthi is represented by Jupiter to remove ignorance and darkness, and to offer wisdom by throwing light. The Ancient Greeks considered Jupiter to be the father of the gods, Zeus. Egyptians called it Ammon, Norse called it Thor, Merodach was the name given by Babylonians and Chaldeans. Jupiter is the God of Righteousness and Justice, and is the symbol of Wisdom. Saivaites regard Jupiter as Dhakshinamurthi, whereas Vaishnavites regard it as Narayana. It is also said that Jupiter is the Deva Guru, whereas Venus is the Asura Guru. They say that both are enemies.

We have to differ from them, as whenever Jupiter and Venus conjoin in the heavens, only prosperity is the result enjoyed by us. They do not clash in the heavens. Jupiter is for the uplift of the soul, leading one to spiritual life without attaching much to domestic life. It is for ParaLoka-Sathana. Venus is for all pleasures, including the car we use, the scent we put on, the furniture we sit on, the bedding we have, the wife we marry, the romance, the love, etc., so that one's mind is more to enjoy the fruits of life in this world. So, there is little time for him to think of God or pray for any advancement in spiritual life. He cares for 'Ilha-Lokha-Sukham'. As their mentality, conduct, etc., are just opposite to each other, they are called enemies, simply to impress on us how they will lead their lives.

If Venus is an enemy to Jupiter, how can Venus have exaltation in enemy's camp Meena, governed by Guru of Jupiter? Therefore, what they say about the planets as enemies should be taken as mentioned above. But this is, in a way, correct. That is, people born in either of the Venus signs will have Jupiter as lord of 6 or lord of 8, and both the ownership are undesirable. Similarly, people born in either of the Jupiter's signs, will have Venus as lord of 6 or lord of 8, and both the ownership are undesirable.

Dhanus or Meena, will have Venus owning the houses 6 or 8, thereby Venus has to cause evil for them just like Mars does for Mercury-borns, and Mercury for Mars-borns. Their mentality will also be just opposite; Mercurians think before they act, whereas Martians act first and think later.

If Jupiter is a benefic to you, by lordship and occupation, and if Jupiter has conjoined with other planets or has any connection with them by occupying their sign, star, etc., you can make a judicious choice and cultivate steady habits, concentrate, meditate, and pray or read stotras on them. Jupiter-Sun Suryanarayana: 'Surya' Navagraha; Jupiter-Moon Rajarajeswari: Lakshmi; Jupiter-Mars Balasubramaniam: Kumaran; Jupiter-Dakshinamurthi czr Narayana; Jupiter-Venus Laxminarayana; Jupiter-Saturn Lord Krishna (Gita Parayana) etc. Jupiter represents Indra and governs power. It rules Rig Veda and Hemantha Ruthu (December and January). It is said to possess and offer 'Sathvaguna’. Our fortunes are governed by Jupiter, who is called the Chief Governor for Money, and is thus referred to as the greater fortune as it rules Finance and Family.

Astrology: Jupiter and the Ninth House in one's horoscope indicate the extent to which one would have done meritorious deeds in their previous birth, and also how much success, honour, fortune, and glory one can have in this life. However, even if other planets are ill-posited and threaten difficulties to a person, if Jupiter is strong and well-posited in a chart, they will enjoy providential help at least at the last moment to tide over the difficulties and get rid of evil. The threatening evil planets will cause such troubles, but Jupiter, as the eleventh-hour friend, will appear at the last moment and save one, just as when "Daniel is come" and his wife is saved.

It was difficult to start a motorbike. It stopped due to a police signal. When the right was given, the cyclist wanted to start, but in the meantime, the car behind him, by chance, knocked at the bike and it started without effort; the car was his god!

A person is surrounded by robbers and while they are removing his cash and possessions, a jeep suddenly appears and the robbers take to their heels, while this person is saved, taken in the jeep, and dropped in a safe place. The thieves, causing anxiety to him, would be governed by Mars; worry may be due to Rahu's position in his horoscope; but Jupiter will be forming a favourable aspect to his ascendant, mostly from Venus sign; hence, the jeep arrived and saved him.

Jupiter is a fiery, noble, benevolent, fruitful, masculine, jovial, buoyant, optimistic, expansive, positive, and dignified planet. The disposition will be generous and candid. Jupiter offers high reasoning ability and proper judgement. The higher attributes of the mind and the uplift of the soul are governed by Jupiter. Hence, it rules educational interests, law, religion, philosophy, banking, company administration, and economics. It also indicates how far one will be religious, will respect the elders, preceptors, mythology, Puranas, Upanishads, etc.

Jupiter rules the sign Sagittarius and also Pisces. It gets exalted in Cancer. The symbol of Sagittarius is the Archer. So, those who are governed by Jupiter will be quick to hit the mark. They love outdoor games and exercises; otherwise, they will feel uneasy. Sagittarius has influence over traveling, as it is the ninth sign of the Zodiac and the Ninth House indicates long journeys. Further, it is a common sign representing pendulum, oscillation, and movement from one place to another and back again.

As Jupiter owns Pisces (Meena), the native will be quiet and unassuming, sociable, ease-loving, and disposed to long journeys, and life in a foreign place. In religion, one will have sincere faith. It will increase the emotional side of the native. There may be some fondness for mysteries. One would like to be a detective or a writer of fiction.

Jupiter's Influence

Jupiter is the ruler of law, so those under its influence will be law-abiding, honest, sincere, and dutiful. They will be logical and broad-minded. Jupiter governs Pisces, the 12th sign of the Zodiac, which opposes the 6th sign of the Zodiac, called the Hospital of the Zodiac. Since the 12th sign Meena is a watery sign, it shows that, by taking medicine by mouth, one can have a cure. In olden days, physicians used to administer the medicine in the "planetary hours" governed by Jupiter. Hindus generally put "2" before they start writing anything so that they can invoke Jupiter's influence by marking its symbol. Physicians, in olden days, also used Jupiter's symbol before writing a prescription. But nowadays, it has changed to "R".

So, Jupiterians will prefer to take medicine orally and have the cure, rather than seek a surgeon's aid. They will avoid surgery as much as possible. Jupiter, as a benefic by lordship, also gives geniality and generosity. Joy, jubilation, and joviality are attributed to this planet. One can expect respect and reputation during its period. Co-operation and congenial atmosphere will be maintained by it; progress and prosperity in life, philosophic and philanthropic nature, good conduct and morals, peace and prosperity, health and wealth are also offered by Jupiter.

If Jupiter is afflicted and owns evil houses, the native will not be moderate but an extremist. They will be very liberal, extravagant, and even lavish. Over-optimism, false hopes, carelessness, debts, disputes, failure in speculation, desperate attempts, gambling, and pressure from creditors and banks, worry through children, false prestige, large donations beyond their normal capacity for charitable institutions, temples, and religion, vain pomp, loss by relying on others and standing surety to them, cheap popularity, default, and infamy, extravagance, gluttony, and unusual girth, lambodhara, misjudgement, and miscalculation are all attributed to Jupiter when it is adversely aspected by other planets and if Jupiter owns unfavorable houses and occupies evil signs and stars.

Physical Features: Jupiter is said to be a judge
Shakespeare has explained a judge as a well-built, fatty, huge-bellied person. Therefore, Jupiterians in youth will have good growth, muscular bodies due to outdoor games, and become so stout that they must be respected at least for their growth. If a man is already sitting in a seat intended for two people, and a Jupiterian later enters, the person will vacate and give room to the new comer. To other persons, it may appear as though the Jupiterian is respected, as the person vacated lest they should be crushed. It rules over the liver, tumors, circulation of blood in the arteries, and fat in the body.

Diseases Caused by Jupiter
Diseases caused by Jupiter include liver complaints, jaundice, dropsy, flatulence, dyspepsia, abscess, hernia, skin troubles, cerebral congestion, catarrh, and carbuncles.

Animals: Horse, Elephant, and Ox

Birds: Peacock

Places: Temples, law courts, colleges and schools, large palatial buildings, durbar halls, legislative assemblies, halls where purohits deliver lectures on Puranas, and other places where religious discourses are held.

Political: Large projects involving heavy expenditure will be undertaken by both big business magnates and the government. Construction of schools, colleges, universities, charitable institutions, hospitals, asylums, sanatoriums, isolation hospitals, ferries, shipping, quarters for servants, bank buildings, renovation of churches, mosques, temples, law courts, etc. will be done on a large scale.

Economic: Free trade without control leads to large yields, mass production, and an easy flow of money, resulting in larger receipts and deposits in the Reserve Bank. Advantages are gained through foreign nations and their aid, as well as benefits from foreign exchange. As a result, activity in the stock exchange will be above normal, with values of shares steadily rising. Bulls will have greater advantages, new companies will come into operation, and dividends and bonus shares will be issued. The government will also gain much through income tax and other indirect taxation.

Products: All fat-containing foodstuffs, such as butter and ghee, as well as sweet-flavoured eatables, large trees, rubber, metals, tin, gold, etc.

Good Aspects to Jupiter: Sun forming a good aspect with Jupiter gives the native a broad outlook. Abundance and rapid recovery from even severe diseases are offered. The native will earn the friendship of all through their cheer, kindness, and sympathy. They will never betray anyone and will think clearly, do their work ably, and judge properly. They will only earn money through fair means and it will never be "tainted money". They will not benefit from the loss of others.

If Mercury were to give the native a promotion, then the higher official would be transferred and that vacancy would be filled by him. If Saturn were to promote him, his senior would mostly pass away, and he would be promoted. If Jupiter were to offer him a promotion in its period, there may be expansion, and he may be lifted by creating a post and in the chain of promotions, he would have his promotion also. Thus, one has to judge.
He may be religious and may be one of the many pillars of religious society. Legal, finance, political, banking, and educational departments and institutions may be his occupation. President, Mayor, Counsellor, M.P., M.L.A., and honorary posts may be offered either by the Sun or by the Moon, forming a good aspect with Jupiter.

Moon Forming Favourable Aspect with Jupiter Gives Noble, Magnanimous, and Optimistic Disposition

He will be popular, honest, and fair. His constitution will get strengthened as he grows, and his reasoning faculty will also improve. His ideals will be lofty and his imagination fertile and fruitful. General success in his life will be mainly due to the good aspect between Moon and Jupiter. There will be no trouble through litigation. He will not be extravagant, meaning he will not spend beyond his means and resources. He will not take desperate chances in speculation or gambling.

Mars and Jupiter in Good Aspect:
The native will possess sincerity, nobility, and honesty, and will be straightforward in their dealings. They will be neither too lavish nor too conservative, and will be successful in business and popular in society due to their ingenuity and constructive ability. They will be drawn to outdoor games and be a good sportsman, which will open up opportunities for them to hold a decent post in any concern, especially if the general manager is a sportsman. This aspect will also bring them love of travel, desire for captaincy, much respect, abundance of health, vitality, power, and endurance. When the native runs the conjoined period of these two planets, they will be able to hold positions such as General Manager, Managing Director, Agent of a Bank, Director of an Industry, President of any Society, Judge, or Religious Head.

Mercury and Jupiter in a Favourable Aspect

The native's life will be greatly enriched by the favourable aspect of Mercury and Jupiter. He will always look on the bright side of things, and even in times of adversity, he will remain in good spirits. His mind will be broad and versatile, and he will form good judgements through intelligent deliberation. He may be slow to form an opinion due to Mercury, but his decisions or conclusions will be incontrovertible.

The native may find success in a variety of occupations, such as law, literature, contact with foreigners, foreign collaboration, export or import, editing, publishing, publicity, mathematics, banking accounts, auditing, and civil engineering. Plurality of interests is indicated by Mercury.

Venus Forming Beneficial Aspect with Jupiter Promises Grand Success and Good Fortune
This native will accumulate wealth, enjoy all the fruits of life, and marry a good wife. He will maintain much social prestige and be ever smiling, jovial, optimistic, and large-hearted. He will have much pleasure and enjoy life to the fullest extent. By traveling, he will form many friendships and will never lack the ability to fulfill his desires. He will not lose through the treachery of others and will have partners in business who are born lucky. He will be liked by all in the society, club, etc. As a politician, he will be loved, admired, and respected by the public. His customers in business will never desert him, and bankers may sometimes go out of their way to help him. Advocates and judges will be of much help.

As Jupiter and Venus denote Accountant General and these two planets do not delay or cause difficulty, his pension accounts, pay sheets, etc., will come in time and he will not suffer. However, those who have Jupiter and Venus forming an evil aspect will not get their pensions in time even with the best efforts of the department for prompt payment.

The native will earn substantially through auditing of accounts, music, animal husbandry, speculation and stock exchange, and through trade in automobiles like cars, articles of luxury like jewels, and scented articles, etc. If in the horoscope of the native, Jupiter receives a good aspect from Saturn, he will have a philosophical turn of mind and will not have much attachment to his relatives or friends. He will have a strong sense of justice and fair play and will earn the love of the young and the old and be esteemed highly in society.

He will come by rich fortune if he is the owner of a mine, a dealer in cement, or a building contractor under a cooperative scheme. He will lead a happy religious life with his wife and children and will enjoy good health and wealth. Later in life, he may practice yogasana and even become a sanyasi.

Uranus Forming Beneficial Aspect with Jupiter

If Uranus forms a beneficial aspect with Jupiter, it will make the individual honest, trustworthy, sincere, and liberal-minded. He will be hospitable and sociable, and will gain through influential friends who hold high positions. He will be an able executive director and may associate himself with secret organizations. He will neither act on impulse nor lose by speculation or lawsuit. There may not be many changes in his life, and if there is a change, it will be due to some windfall. Those who have become very rich in a short period of time will have this beneficial aspect.

Neptune and Jupiter in a good aspect will crown the native with success, as his character will be well-developed. He will have an inspirational and mystical nature, and will never be rash. He will never start a bubble company without forethought and allow it to end in a crash. He will control his emotions and be wise, with a spiritual turn of mind and will observe religious ceremonies. He will gain through export and import trade and overseas connections, and will not lose in speculation.

Jupiter's Direction is Northeast. It is in Sextile to the Vernal Equinox.

## VENUS - THE PLEASANT PARTNER

Astronomy: Hindus considered Venus to be the most brilliant planet even at the dawn of history, appearing some months as the evening star and some months as the morning star. Other nations gave Venus two names, Phosphrous and Hesperus, as they thought the morning star Venus was different from the evening star Venus. Around 500 B.C., the great Greek geometer Pythagoras confirmed that both the morning and evening stars were identical.

Venus presents as a brilliant disc especially in the early morning, when agriculturists in the villages begin their routine work in the lands and Vedic Brahmins begin their daily routine prayers, etc. Venus is the brightest planet and can, at her best, outshine Sirius by 12 to 13 times.

Venus is much closer to the Sun than the Earth. Therefore, on some occasions, Venus will be between Earth and Sun, and on some occasions the Sun will be in between Earth and Venus. The average distance between the Sun and Venus is 67 million miles, with very little variation as the orbit of Venus is almost circular. The distance between Earth and Venus, during inferior conjunction, will be only 25 million miles.

The size of Venus is similar to that of the Earth, with a diameter of 700 miles compared to the Earth's 7900 miles. Its period is 225 days. The atmospheric layer around Venus is thick, peculiar, and fascinating. The brightness of Venus is due to the reflecting power of its atmosphere.

For observers on Earth, Venus can never be more than 48 degrees from the Sun. Therefore, when Venus is the evening star and 48 degrees away from the Sun, we can see it in the heavens for about 3 hours and 12 minutes after sunset.

Mythology: Venus is considered to be the Goddess of love, marriage, beauty, and comforts. It is called Maha Lakshmi, wife of Lord Vishnu, and is also known as one-eyed. The story is meant to impress upon the mind that if Venus is ill-posited, the eye will be affected.

Bali Chakravarthi was ruling both the Earth and the Heavens. The Devas and Indra appealed to Lord Vishnu to free them from Maha Bali. So, Lord Vishnu took the form of a dwarf and approached the emperor Bali, begging him to give three feet of land for his use. Bali had a wise preceptor, named Sukracharya, who understood the trick of the Lord and advised the emperor not to grant the request. In spite of it, Bali granted the request by pouring water in the hands of Lord Vishnu appearing in dwarf form. Sukracharya blocked the passage of the water by one of his eyes. Lord Vishnu took a grass and pierced through the eye of the Guru as though he was removing the obstacle, thus causing Sukracharya to lose an eye.

Venus is also known as Lucifer and Hesperus. Greeks call it Aphrodite; the Babylonians call it NANA; the Hebrews named it Astoreth; Assyrians called Venus Isktar; and the Phoenicians called it Astarte. Venus rules Yajur Veda and Vasantha Rithu (April and May). Venus is called Kama, for one's passion depends on the strength of Venus and the aspects it receives, as Venus is chiefly concerned with the emotional outlets and character.

Astrology: Venus is a feminine planet. It rules the signs Taurus-Rishaba and Libra-Thulam, the second and seventh signs of the Zodiac. The former is an earthy and fixed sign, whereas the latter is an airy and movable one. Being a feminine planet, it governs gentle and refined attributes. That is why people ruled by Venus are kind and sociable. Taurus suggests that the native will be endowed with a pleasant and handsome countenance, as it is the second sign of the Zodiac; for the second house indicates one's cheek, eyes, etc. Libra shows that one will have a symmetrical form, graceful manners, will be inclined to purchase peace at any price, and be level-headed and will try to lead a happy and harmonious wedded life. By their pleasing personality, calmness, patient hearing to what others say, and refined nature, they will soften the ruffled feelings of others, change their attitude and prove to be peacemakers. Also, Venus furnishes the bond between all members of the family, whatever may be the relationship. Libra, being the seventh sign of the Zodiac, Venus shows love. Mr. Max Heindel says, "Venus vaunteth not herself, is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, rejoices not in inquiry but in truth, beareth all things, believeth all things and endureth all things."

Venus gets exalted in Pisces-Meena. Its Moolatrikona sign is Libra-Thulam. It gets debilitated in Virgo-Kanni. Aries and Scorpio are the houses of detriment to it. Pisces is the 12th sign of the Zodiac. The 12th house indicates Suka Sayana or conjugal bliss. Hence, a strong Venus in a chart is a testimony that the native will have attraction to the other sex early in life; also, they will have attraction to all matters contributing to amusement and gratification of the senses. Pisces is misused in those cases where they have the conjunction or aspect from both planets, Mars and Saturn, as Saturn is to deviate from man-made law and Mars is to give opportunity, courage and strength to avail. In Taurus, Moon gets exalted, whereas in Libra, Saturn is exalted. No planet is debilitated in Taurus; but Sun is debilitated in Libra. This is a testimony that Venus is for Iha-Loka-Sukha and it can bestow one all comforts, enabling them to lead a pleasant life in this world.

Physical Features: Venus produces people of average height, plump body, round and pimpled face, or oval and very attractive one, bright, kind, and pleasing eyes, a pleasant voice, a sweet smile, and curly hair. If Venus is adversely afflicted, it bestows less beauty. Generally, Venusians are the winners in any competition, especially when they apply for the reception department, as private secretaries, salesmen, propagandists, etc. Other than the occasion when a choice is to be made among a few competitors for marriage.

Part of the Body: Venus governs the eyes, the generative system, the throat, the chin, the cheeks, the kidneys, etc.

Diseases

Affection in the eye, irregularity in the catamenia, diseases of the ovaries, mucous diseases, skin diseases, Bright's disease, swelling, goitre, gout, anaemia, and other complications due to over-indulgence in amusements, eating, drinking, etc., including gonorrhea and syphilis can all be caused by afflictions to the Sun and Venus. If Mars, Moon, and Venus are ill-posited in a horoscope, then the native will have a discharge for a larger number of days and the quantity will be profuse. If Saturn afflicts, then the discharge will be scanty, but the pain near the chest and the lower abdominal region will be present for some days before and after the period. If Mars, Venus, and Sun are afflicted, then the native will have to undergo treatment by a surgeon to have a child. If Saturn afflicts Sun and Venus, one may have fibroid tumours. If Jupiter afflicts Sun and Venus, it indicates cancer. If Mercury afflicts by the semi-square or semi-demi-square aspect with Venus, one may have nervous disorders which may lead to hysteria. As Venus represents the beauty of the skin, when afflicted by Saturn or Kethu, one will suffer from eczema, leprosy, or leucoderma. Thus, considering the adverse aspect to Venus, one is to judge the nature of the disease.

Injuries May Be Caused by Accidents Involving Any Vehicle, Such as Car Accidents, Plane Accidents, or Carts Running Over Someone, as Well as Cycles. They May Also Be Caused by Animals and Birds Governed by Venus, Such as Panthers, Bulls, Cows, Buffaloes, Goats, etc. Those Who Keep Birds and Animals as a Hobby May Have Peacocks, Sparrows, etc.

Places: Bedroom, Dance and Dining Room, Cinema Theatre, Drama Hall, Garden, Nursery, Fountains, Banqueting Hall, Scent Manufacturing Factory, Automobile Industrial Places, Shipping Yards, Aerodrome, Chemical Industrial Areas, Silk and Rayon Industrial Quarters, Mica Mines (if Saturn is conjoined with, or aspecting Venus), Glass Manufacturing Places, etc.

Political: Ceasefire, peace, and prosperity in the country. No more necessity for control or permits, but opportunity for free trade laws favorable for transport, railway, shipping, etc., for the people, musicians, and ladies, an expansion program, and export facility for silk, textile, rayon, toiletries, perfumeries, mica, chemicals, cinema films, and women's welfare.

Economics: Satisfactory dividends, good relationships among partners and shareholders, issue of bonus shares, improvement of the industry and much prosperity, rise in share prices, and flotation of new companies dealing in any of the products governed by Venus.

Products: The finished goods of the textile, silk, and rayon industries; silver, copper, glass mica, toilets, perfumery, fancy goods, photographs, films, hosiery for ladies, confectionery, sandalwood oil, fruits, flowers, sugar, chemicals, rubber, cars, ships, aeroplanes, embroidery, tailoring machines, musical instruments, radios, paints, milk, petrol, cotton, pomegranates, gooseberries, sandalwood, dandelions, jasmine, musk, punugu, nutmeg, condiments, Asoka trees, cherries, white poppies, chestnut figs, apples, and all other juicy and tasty fruits, rubber, and tobacco.

Profession
Musicians, gamblers, cinema actors, actresses, film producers, and those employed in transport, automobile, railway, bus, taxi, lorry, air travel, shipping, food department, animal husbandry, slaughter house, agriculture, estates, coffee, tea, rubber, opticians, glass, mica, and plastic, linen drapers, tailors, painters, jewelers, players, embroiderers, those employed to make-up, dress, comb, fiddlers, pipers, and those involved in drama, dealers in musical instruments, and other related products can be predicted based on the strength of the second house, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn. If the second house is strong and Venus indicates one's profession, he will be a vocal musician, a singer, or poet. If the third house has a connection with Neptune and Venus, he will be using string instruments. If the sign is a short one, such as Aquarius, he will play the violin. But if it is Gemini or Libra, a sign of long ascension, he will have a Veena. If Venus is in the third or ninth house and is having a beneficial aspect from Mercury, and if either is in an airy sign, he may be good at playing the flute or Nagaswaram. Short signs, such as Aquarius, indicate the flute, while long signs portray fertile imagination and he may be interested in Jaladharangam. A strong Mars, receiving a good aspect from Venus, shows that he will be acquainted with Gatam. Saturn, Venus, and Mars indicate that he will be an expert in Mridangam, as Mars is for manual labour, Venus for skin, and Saturn for the dead and hence for leather. Therefore, this combination is necessary for them.

Rulership:
Venus is known as Kalathra Karaka, meaning that it is the chief governor for marriage. It shows whether one will be faithful in love and allow their partner to enjoy life, or if they will be troublesome and unreliable, making married life a living hell.
Venus also indicates the partner in business, if it has any connection with the second, sixth, and tenth houses in the horoscope.
Venus is the chief planet connected with vehicles, known as Vahana Karaka. The fourth house and Venus indicate whether one can have the comforts of conveyance, etc.
For those born during the day, Venus is the Karaka for mother. (The fourth house and its lord also signify mother.)

Lucky Colors: White, Cream, Ivory
Lucky Numbers: 6, 15, 24, 33, 42, 51, etc.
Lucky Day: Friday
Lucky Metal and Stone: Copper, Silver, Brass, Beryl, Coral, Jade, Diamond, Alabaster
Lucky Star: On days when the Moon transits in Bharani, Poorva Palguni, and Poorvashada stars.

Modification and Aspects of Venus:
As Venus is never more than 48 degrees away from the Sun, the only aspects which can be formed with the Sun are:
1. Conjunction : when both are together either within 12 degrees when Venus approaches the Sun or within 17 degrees when Venus gets separated from the Sun. (Good)
2. Parallel: Equal distance from the celestial equator north or south, or one north and the other south.
3. Vigintile: 18 degrees away, which is moderately good.
4. Semi-demi-square: When both of them are 22 and a half degrees away, which is evil.
5. Semi-Sextile: When they are 30 degrees apart, which produces favourable results due to a harmonious aspect.
6. Semi-quintile or decile: 36 degrees, which is the longitudinal distance between them, which is also a favourable one.
7. Semi-square: Or 45 degrees distance between them, which is evil. Thus, seven aspects are possible and according to the aspect, one can expect beneficial or adverse results in their joint periods; i.e., in their dasa and bhukties, and also when they form an aspect during progression and transit.

Effects of Sun and Venus in Close Conjunction
For those who have Venus as their ruling planet, a close conjunction of the Sun and Venus indicates that the native will enjoy sociability, pleasure, comfort, luxury, and clubs, societies, and places of entertainment. They will be hospitable and generous, with a cheerful and courteous nature. They will be fond of art, music, and poetry, and may be successful musicians or film producers.

If the Sun and Venus occupy the 5th, 7th, or 9th house, it may indicate that the native's wife is defective or has a disease in the generative system. An adverse aspect may lead to delays in marriage or disappointment, and a lack of harmony in domestic life. The extent of the harm done depends on other bad aspects as well. These effects will be experienced in their mutual dasas, bhukties, and anthras. If the Sun is the significator of marriage, the partner's star may be Karthikai or Pooram.

Moon Forming Good Aspect with Venus:
The person who has this beneficial aspect and to whom Venus is the ruling planet, by being born in one of its signs or in Ascendant with Venus strong therein, will, by nature, be polished and refined. They will be inclined to develop art and will appear beautiful through their neat dress, and also by the use of fragrant scent, powder, etc, to a limited extent. They will be fond of music, pleasure, light literature, cinema, drama, and other entertainments. They will be affectionate and attractive, gentle and good, sociable and sympathetic. They will be treated with respect in the company of young people of the opposite sex. 

If Venus is the significator of their earnings, it promises splendid earnings, probability of rich inheritance through mother or wife or both, possession of luxurious and costly articles, furniture, and vehicles, etc. Naturally, their intelligence and imagination will be improved, and this will contribute to a happy and harmonious life. The following proverb will prove to be true in their cases: "The gown is hers that wears it, and the world is his who enjoys it". They may have satisfactory earnings, by catering to public tastes and needs, by running confectioneries, restaurants, boarding and lodging houses, or dealing in perfumeries, music, cinema, petrol, transport, shipping etc. They will be careless in habits and manners. The relationship among the partners will be very cordial; they cannot suffer scandal and unpopularity. 

If Moon is a significator of marriage, the partner's star may be Rohini and 23rd May to 6th June will be lucky. Adverse aspects will give the most undesirable results and will make the native's life horrible and not worth living.

Mars Forming Good Aspect with Venus

Mars owns Aries and Scorpio, while Venus owns Libra and Taurus, and the two planets are antagonistic in their qualities. Mars represents masculine, bold, militant, and rash action, while Venus indicates peace, harmony, calmness, and courtesy. This aspect portrays that one will be courteous, well-behaved with pleasing manners and attracting all by their personal charm. It gives courage and confidence. One will be fond of adventure, amorous, and ambitious. They may be proficient in instrumental music and have a hobby of dealing in cars. They may also be extravagant.

Mars aspecting Venus promises greater earning capacity and ability, but it will not allow them to save as much as one who has the good aspect of Saturn to Venus. Mars gives enough of energy, authority, responsibility, tact, push, and activity. If Mercury also forms a good aspect, one will not mind spending money on advertisement, display, show, and propaganda. They may also be the patrons for most of the clubs, societies, and sabhas. They will be able to make good gain through sports, and may get lucrative posts in any office, even if they are not fully qualified for it. They may also have practical artistic ability or mechanical skill, as well as expertise in automobile engineering, tailoring, singing, dancing, owning cinema theaters, producing films, salesmanship, dress, jewels, ornaments, diamonds, textiles, photography, agriculture, coffee, and tea board, etc.

Adverse aspect of Mars to Venus leads one to an immoral life. This may create many enemies due to rivalry, spite, and jealousy, and life will not be smooth. Passion cannot be controlled, and there may be separation and dispute, which may even end in divorce. If Saturn also forms an evil aspect, it may lead to the murder of the other partner. Worry through womenfolk, overindulgence, deranged health, loss of money, scandal, and ill-repute are the unfavourable results. A few may meet with accidents through conveyance.

In the case of those who have good aspects, if Mars is the significator of marriage, the partner may be born in Bharani star or Mrigasirisha first half or Chithirai second half, and the lucky period may be between April 26th to 10th May, between 8th June and 14th June, and between 17th October and 23rd October.

Effects of Mercury Forming Good Aspect with Venus
Mercury and Venus can never be more than 76 degrees apart, so they can only form a few aspects which are moderate in strength and give results. The strong aspects such as squares and trines cannot be formed. Good aspects make the native good-natured and they will keep all members cheerful with their pleasant and humorous talk. They will be good artists, developing taste in the fine arts, music, etc. They will have keen imagination and proficiency in literature, sanitary engineering, poetry, comedy, and drama-writing, and will mostly have contact with literates. They will not hesitate to stand surety for anyone without getting entangled later. They will have plurality of interests and will gain money mostly as agents, salesmen, brokers, managers to ladies well-placed in life, or as assistants to actresses, musicians, etc., or by playing second violin and pleasing employers. If Saturn also forms a favourable aspect, the natives will deal in Frigidaire. Mars, by lending its beneficial aspect, indicates that they may deal in electric heaters, motor batteries, etc.

If there are adverse aspects, the native should never stand surety to anyone, nor sign cheques, etc., without properly scrutinising them. Mental worry and ill repute are threatened. Any confidential letter written to an intimate friend belonging to the opposite sex may fall into the hands of others, and the secret activities will be revealed. As Mercury represents the postal authorities, the letter may be mistakenly delivered to a wrong person or at the wrong moment. If Jupiter is not favourable, one may be sure that one day or other, the person will have to pay a penalty to the Income-Tax department, especially during the joint periods of Mercury and Venus.

Benefits of Jupiter Forming a Good Aspect with Venus

The two planets Jupiter and Venus are the brightest and are very strong benefics by nature. Hence, the persons will be polite, dutiful, honest, chaste, and faithful. They will have faith in occult science and in God. They will follow tradition and will never dare to break the law, nor will they contribute to a breach of peace. They will cultivate universal love, both brotherhood and sisterhood. They will be just in their actions and very hospitable. Charity, purity, piety, equity, and equanimity are bestowed on the persons having this beneficial aspect. One will have the desire to have higher studies with the facility and opportunity to study. Success is also assured in their ventures. Good health and a smooth life for a long number of years are also presaged. They will be able to get a good financier who will be honest and ever helpful. Much gain and success in business are assured. One can prosper in court of law, income tax, sales tax, etc., bank, women's college; honor and reputation will be on the increase; one may become the trustee of a temple; director of any company dealing in luxurious commodities; manager or cashier in the transport department. By marrying one in a high circle, one's position and finance will suddenly improve. One can enjoy all the fruits of life in this world and also be pious and God-fearing. Useful investments, a rise in career, the birth of a child, and good luck are indicated. If Jupiter happens to be the significator of a wife or husband, she or he may be born in Poorvashada star or Visakam first three quarters in Libra sign. The lucky period will be between 26th December to 10th January, or 7th November to 7th November.

Saturn Forming Good Aspect with Venus

Generally, those who have a good aspect between Venus and Saturn will experience a rise in life, followed by a greater fall. Saturn represents the grave, so the evil Saturn will ensure that the person is one foot in the grave.

Before launching an enterprise, one will consider deeply. Fertile imagination, farsightedness, steadiness, perseverance, honesty, and sincerity will make one very good at planning and scheming. The native will hold a responsible position of trust and meet all reasonable expenses. They will be economical, prudent, and frugal, but not miserly.

Legacy through marriage, gain through investment in lands, gardens, nurseries, stocks and shares, and businesses relating to coal, mine produce, leather, skin and hides, and cotton textiles will bring prosperity in mine-engineering. A good aspect of Saturn to Venus shows marriage in the proper age and mutual love between the couple. However, an adverse aspect will threaten either with a delay in marriage, denial, or disappointment, or both partners may seek satisfactory pleasure with strangers, old people, widows, or widowers. This will lead to a loss of moral backbone, financial loss, domestic worry, separation, bereavement, disappointment, and ill health, such as eczema, venereal troubles, and leprosy. There may be difficulty in inheriting property, the appointment of a guardian, or the father writing out a will and leaving the property in the names of the person's children, denying the native all rights. This could lead to a loss of position, scandal, reversals, and downfall, and even good friends may shun the native's society. One may be charged with bribery, dishonesty, falsification of accounts, favouritism, or prosecuted for debauchery or drink, and there may be litigation and divorce. Jupiter

Venus Receiving Good Aspects from Rahu and Jupiter

Kethu: As Rahu and Kethu do not have a sign, find out in which star and sign they are. Consider the lords of the star and the sign as if they are individually aspecting Venus. Both results will be enjoyed, especially during the period of the lord of the star and the sign during Venus Dasa or Venus Bhukthi.

Venus Receiving Good Aspect from Uranus:
The person will have an attractive personality and be exceedingly magnetic, particularly to the opposite sex. They will also attract a host of powerful friends who will be helpful to them. In any competition, they will come out successful due to their magnetic and charming personality. Mentally, they will be alert, active, bright, intuitive, quick, and inspirational. This aspect gives them a love of art, music, poetry, discovery, and research. When they meet someone suddenly, they will fall in love with them and be happy as though a Gandharva Vivaham has taken place. Uranus will assist them by this aspect, allowing for quick and sudden consummation. They will be much attached to the other, as the eccentricity of Uranus is toned down by the soft and peaceful Venus. Marriage will be a happy and harmonious one, with no trouble or jealousy through courtship or wedding. They will not be so hasty as to commit a mistake and divorce later, like Dhusyantha who ought to have had both the beneficial aspect of Uranus to Venus and also the evil aspect from Mars and Saturn to Venus.

Railway, air travel, research, fine arts, investments, and speculation are some of the sources through which one can make money. It is also likely to have a windfall when Uranus forms a good aspect with Venus during its transit, and when Venus dasa or Venus bhukti and a favourable sub period operates. When Venus receives a good aspect from Neptune, the person will be versatile; Neptune gives fertile imagination and deep emotions. They will be pure and maintain a sterling character, provided there is no evil aspect from Mars and Saturn to Venus. Neptune indicates that the partner is reliable and faithful, mostly due to their kindness, sympathy, and love. One may have an interest in mystical subjects, or be a successful speculator or a good musician, if Neptune is in the 5th house. Neptune gives proficiency in instrumental music, especially when one does Raga Alapana. For Swaram, Mercury also must form a good aspect. Cinema film producers are very successful through those pictures which are released at the time Neptune, by transit, forms a strong beneficial aspect with both its original position at the time of birth, and also with Venus in the radical chart.

Neptune forming a good aspect shows that the native will be successful, join a happy society, spend a mirthful time, engage in devotional practices, and enjoy extreme prosperity. However, if Neptune forms an evil aspect, one must exercise care in food and drinks and avoid narcotics. There is always the danger of ptomaine poisoning and misplaced confidence can land one in trouble. There is also the danger from secret organisations. It is advisable not to have a partner or private secretary in business, as they may be cheats and bring in mental worry, financial loss, ill repute, etc. One will be wasting money through ladies without any benefit or pleasure.

## SATURN - SANI

Astronomy: Our Ancients Knew Only the Seven Planets

Our ancient ancestors were aware of seven planets: the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Saturn, known as "Sanaischara," moves along the Zodiac slowly compared to the other planets. It is the outermost planet known to them. However, Uranus, Neptune, and other planets discovered more recently are farther away from the Sun and Earth and move much more slowly than Saturn. Saturn is visible to the unaided eye.

Saturn is surrounded by a system of three concentric rings. These rings are separate, with only black empty space in between any two rings. Saturn appears like a blue ball with three yellow rings. It is 886 million miles away from the Sun and is smaller than Jupiter, with a diameter of around 75,000 miles. It has nine moons. Saturn is about 700 times larger in volume than Earth, but its weight is less than 100 times that of Earth.

Saturn takes nearly 29.5 years to go around the Sun. Therefore, on average, Saturn passes through each sign for a period of over 2.5 years.

Mythology: Saturn is Called 'Yama'

Why is Saturn called 'Yama'? It is the chief governor for 'Longevity' and carries out the duty of God Siva or Rudhra. Saturn is a cold, icy planet, which is why it is said that "Icy hands are laid on one" meaning that one is dead. Saturn is the father of the two significators of evil, Gulika and Mandhi, and is also called Neelan and Mandhan. It is said that when Indrajit was about to be born, Saturn stretched its leg from the 11th house to the 12th, so that Saturn could fill the child with pride and bring about a great fall eventually. Ravana tried to keep all planets in the 11th house at the time of the birth of his son, Indrajit, as planets in the 11th house will invariably do good to the person concerned. However, the Devas, realising the consequences, appealed to Saturn who encouraged the Devas by saying that he alone could sanction what they wanted, with least effort. Saturn in the 11th house is very good, but Saturn in the 12th house is very, very bad. So, Saturn stretched its leg to the 12th Bhava. When Ravana was informed that a son was born, he wanted to confirm whether all planets were occupying the 11th house. To his distress, Saturn was found stretching its leg to the 12th house. Ravana, noted for his rash and foolhardy actions, suddenly cut off the leg of Saturn. Hence, Saturn is called 'Lame', meaning that Saturnians are slow.

Saturn is the son of Sun, and their qualities and characteristics are diametrically opposed to each other. Saturn also never agrees with Moon. This is why Saturn is allotted Capricorn and Aquarius, the signs just opposite to those of the luminaries. According to Westerners, Saturn is the son of Uranus, who married Rhea. When he understood that children born to him would govern the world, he destroyed them. But Jupiter survived. So when Jupiter was born, the mother gave him some hard stuff wrapped in cloth which Saturn did away with. But Jupiter escaped. God always pays everyone in the same coin, and Saturn was dethroned by Uranus, in turn, Jupiter deprived Saturn and taught the law of nature.

There are many stories about Saturn. A few others say that Saturn represents 'Brahma', but this is not supported by the general role that Saturn plays in human lives. To me, the conception of Saturn representing Lord Siva-Rudhra is more appealing. Sun may be called the 'Brahma', as well as Jupiter, but Saturn has the characteristics of Siva doing the duty of Siva, which is why Navagrahas are installed in Siva temples, and Saturn is called Neelan and Siva is called Neelakantan. Saturn rules Sasira Ruthu-February and March, the cold months of the year. I am sure, it is the work of a benefic Saturn".

Astrology: Saturn is a barren, binding, cold, constant, dry, defensive, hard, nervous, and secretive planet. It governs the houses Capricorn and Aquarius. The moolatrikona house, or the day house, is Aquarius and the night house is Capricorn. Though Saturn is the son of the Sun, it rules the sign opposite to that of the Sun. Saturn's exalted sign is Thula or Libra, where the Sun gets debilitated. Saturn's debilitated sign is Aries, which is the exaltation sign of the Sun. Leo, owned by the Sun, and Cancer, owned by the Moon, are the houses of fall for Saturn.

Saturn is said to occupy friend's quarters in Mithuna (Gemini) or Kanni (Virgo) ruled by Mercury and Rishaba (Taurus) and Thulam (Libra) ruled by Venus, and is considered to be in an enemy's camp while occupying other houses. Saturn is considered to be very favorable for people born in the signs owned by Venus, whereas Saturn is evil to those born in the signs governed by Mercury.

Saturn, according to Uttara Kalamrita, proves to be beneficial when it is in its own sign or when it occupies the signs of Jupiter or when it is exalted. But, one peculiarity has to be carefully remembered. If Saturn, by lordship, is a benefic, then it should not be strong by being in Swakshethra, exalted, or Vargothama to produce favorable results during Venus sub period. Kalidas is of the opinion that a strong Raja Yoga Saturn in Venus period will make one beg aims in the street even if the person is born a King or a Kubera.

According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, Saturn ruling the constellations Pushya, Anuradha, and Uthrapadhra will modify the results of planets in any of the three stars so much that what Saturn has to offer to the native by its lordship and occupation is given by the planet in its star(s).

Saturn will cause delay. It can deny. It will disappoint. Disharmony, dispute, difficulty, despondency, dejection, and differences are the outcome of an evil Saturn. Plodding, persevering, patiently working, prudence, frugality, economy, saving, endurance, industry, thrift, power to keep secrets, stability, self-control, sense of duty, etc., are attributed to a beneficial Saturn. Lazy, lethargic, and idle persons are born under the influence of a malefic Saturn. Never will they have the mind to work. If they begin to do anything, some impediment, obstacle, or hindrance dissuades or discourages them. They become diffident; there is the fear whether it would be possible to come out successful. So they are anxious; they suspect others. Saturn causes distrust.

Saturnians will always miss the bus. They are mostly late to start, to do, to receive the benefit, etc. They may try to speak on the platform; they may prepare well; but they will remember the points only after they resume their seats. Students under the influence of Saturn cannot recollect all points; when they come out of the examination hall, they will recollect everything. A Saturnian may visit a friend's house for a particular work. On reaching the place, he will spend the time on other things. There will be some hindrance and he will find it difficult to attend to his work.

Saturn is a powerful planet either as a malefic or as a benefic. Let us see what a benefic Saturn has done. One student, while consulting me said, "Sir, I am in love with a girl. I think, from the way in which she conducts herself, she is also in love with me. Daily, in the morning she comes by a bus and I wait in the bus stand till that bus comes. I jump into it. Believe me or not, everyday, I find at least one friend of my father sitting by her side and offer a seat next to him or away from her. In the evening, I experience similar obstacles. On important days, the phone gets out of order. I am sure, it is the work of a benefic Saturn."

Astrologers say that I am running Saturn's period; there is always some difficulty or the other in the way of fulfillment of my wishes. What do you say? The reply was this: 'That you run Saturn's period is correct. But Saturn is a benefic to you. The girl whom you love is one of the twins. Thank this Saturn! Do you know why? You would have mistaken the other twin and behaved in a distasteful manner. Consider your position and that of her sister whom you love. Luckily, old persons representing Saturn intervened and saved you from such a dirty situation. Saturn will delay, so be cautious and careful." This is how a benefic Saturn saves. See how a malefic Saturn wrecks. I went to my friend's house to borrow money and when I pressed the calling bell, the person to whom I owed money opened the door and said in a loud voice, "How many times am I to demand money from you? When do you propose to make the payment?" The house owner whom I wanted to approach asked what the matter was. Readers will be knowing who would have answered this question. 
The fellow who opened the door narrated the story and ended by saying that I was a defaulter for many years. Now, who is Saturn? The fellow who opened the door.
People born on Saturdays, or in Capricorn or Aquarius as Ascendants, or in the constellations Pushya or Anuradha or Uthrapathra, will take on the role of Saturn and do good or evil depending on the favourable or unfavourable position of Saturn during its period. Saturn is the chief governor for longevity, occupying the house of longevity, i.e. the 8th house, and gives a long span of life to the native. Jupiter is the chief governor for production and expansion, and hence as Jupiter produces, Saturn destroys to maintain equilibrium. People born under the influence of Saturn do not relish hot stuff, preferring cold dishes, preferably preserved in a frigidaire, as Saturn is a cold planet. They also prefer old and preserved food stuff, and astringent and sour tastes.
Saturn, when benefic, makes a person true, reliable, honest, sincere, faithful, and chaste. It also aids for concentration, meditation, and prayers. A Jupiterian is a Vedantist, Purohit, or preacher (whether they practise or not), whereas a Saturnian is one who practices, does not preach much, grows a beard, observes silence (mounam), keeps up penance, avoids feasts, but now and then periodically fasts, prefers seclusion, and shuns society. Jupiter is for expansion, improvement, and opening many branches, whereas Saturn consolidates, concentrates, and is economical and calculating. The colour of Saturn is blue. When one is filled with sorrow or depressed, one should not use blue colour, but instead use red, symbolising the character of Mars, to gather courage and be active. Whenever a person runs the evil period of Saturn, some friends may suggest to use blue colour, but one should not fall victim to this, and instead use red or pure gold. Saturn gives such diseases as take a long time to be cured, and all chronic ailments, particularly those of the bony system, are attributable to Saturn. Saturn denotes all matters kept hidden or in secret, and the subject of geology is governed by him. Saturn is next to Mars in indicating lands and estates, and gives pure blue, black, dark brown, and indigo as colours prescribed to Saturn by Westerners.

Physical Features:
Saturn produces people who are thin-built, bony, and pale, or of a dark complexion. The face may appear melancholic or much older than the person's actual age. The eyes are deep-set and may appear as though they are staring. Piercing eyes with a profuse growth of dark hair on the eyebrows are distinguishing features of a Saturnian. Generally, Saturn makes one a little deaf. The person may request that people repeat what they say and hold their hands near their ears, suggesting that the speaker speak loudly. The limbs are usually long and thin.

Parts of the Body: Osseous System - Bones, Hair and Growth, Ears, Teeth, Pneumogastric Nerve

Diseases and Defects
Saturn and Moon forming an unfavourable aspect can cause obstruction of lymphatic circulation, nutrition, retention of waste in the body, hardened membranes, pyorrhea, and pasteurization. Smallpox is caused by the adverse aspect between Saturn, Mars, and Moon, which results in pus. Chickenpox, however, is caused by Mars and Moon alone, and ends in a vesicular stage.
Saturn and Mars in an evil aspect can cause falls, injury, bruises, operations, amputations, fractures, curvature of the spine, and gallstones. Mercury afflicted by Saturn can produce a fear complex that appears like madness, ear trouble, deafness (with pus in the ear if Moon is also afflicted), chills, cold, diphtheria, asthma, pulmonary consumption, defective speech, paralysis, Vitamin B and enzyme deficiencies.
Saturn and Jupiter in mutual affliction can cause impotency, constipation, sciatica, Bright's disease, locomotor ataxia, nausea, and cancer. Sun and Saturn in an adverse aspect can cause high blood pressure, cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral anemia, thrombosis, cardiac trouble, and gout. Venus and Saturn in an evil aspect can cause venereal diseases, leprosy, eczema, baldness, black or blue patches, and weakness due to malpractices.

## THE NODES - RAHU AND KETHU

There Is a Vast Amount of Literature Descriptive About the Seven Planets: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn
From time immemorial, these seven planets have been recognized, studied, understood, and honored. The fact that the seven days of the week have been named after the seven planets in the order mentioned above shows that our ancients had a profound knowledge of them and that they, in their characteristic way, defined the planets and named the days of the week after them. However, very little is said about Rahu and Kethu. Out of the galaxy of influential planets, they were taken into cognizance in explaining all heavenly phenomena and recognized the need and existence of Rahu and Kethu. Later, astrologers built up a theory about the existence and influence of these two chayagrahas or shadowy points. Observation and scientific analysis have fully confirmed their intuition, and today we have a meagre but unconnected amount of knowledge of Rahu and Kethu, whereby it is well recognized that they have a distinct, profound, and predictable influence on human lives and destinies. Western science is even poorer in their knowledge of these two points.

Let me collect, collate, and arrange existing knowledge on a logical and understandable basis. We shall consider (1) what Rahu and Kethu are, (2) their natures and characteristics, (3) their influence in various houses, (4) their effects through aspects and combinations, and finally (5) their place in predictive astrology according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati.

What Do We Mean by Rahu and Kethu?
Rahu and Kethu are not physical celestial bodies with a visible form, shape, or mass like the Sun, Moon, and other planets. Therefore, our ancestors assigned them certain houses in the zodiac, considering their influence. Hindu mythology has symbolized them as two parts of a single body. Our sages have gone beyond what scientific observation and deduction can tell us when describing their natures and the divine laws governing them. The descriptions are surprisingly accurate, even though modern minds may view them as childish stories or fairy tales. To understand the profound truths contained in the Hindu Puranas, one must study them deeply and reverently. Those who merely skim them will only recognize their apparent absurdity. Pearls are not gathered by surf riders; only divers can harvest them.

The Forces of Good and Evil

The forces of good and evil have been a part of creation since the beginning of time, and Hindu Theology has symbolized this clash as a war between the Devas and Asuras. The Devas are naturally good and bring good to the world, while the Asuras are naturally evil and bring harm to the world. This war is eternal, and the aim of the creator is for good to ultimately triumph over evil.

The Puranas tell of a churning of the ocean of life by two armies of Devas and Asuras, which resulted in the creation of a divine elephant, a horse, a physician, the Goddess of wealth, and finally, Amrita or immortality. It is natural that strength, skill, wisdom, wealth, and success should come from this struggle between elemental forces, and that good should ultimately prevail. The Supreme Lord is said to have distributed the Amrita among the contestants. He tricked the wicked by taking the form of an alluring woman, Mohini, which literally means "confusing brain". The forces of evil were tempted, while the Devas or forces of good received a share of the Amrita.

One of the Asuras also had an impulse to do good, even though he was naturally evil. He joined the ranks of the Devas and received a share of the Amrita, but was discovered and exposed by the Sun and the Moon. As luminaries, it is reasonable that they should reveal or expose the evil or darkness. The Supreme Lord could not allow a force of evil to become immortal, so he cut it with his sword. The Asura was beheaded, but as a drop of Amrita had been tasted by him, both the sundered parts remained alive, though separated. This is spoken of as the serpent cut into two, the head being called "Rahu" and the body and tail "Ketu". It is natural that Rahu and Ketu should hate the Sun and the Moon, and they are forever at war. Periodically, they succeed in swallowing the Sun and the Moon, but they escape as they are immortal. Eclipses are the moments when Rahu and Ketu swallow the Sun or the Moon. This allegory symbolizes the origin and nature of Rahu and Ketu.

We Shall Consider the Second Tale of the Moon and His Wives
The orbit of the Moon is studied with stars and 27 groups of stars through which the Moon passes in one circuit are called the 27 wives of the Moon. Our Puranas say that the Moon, quite like us mortals, was fonder of some of his wives than of others and thus there was dissatisfaction and jealousy among the wives. Krithika and Rohini were loved best by the Moon and so the rest complained about this preference to their common father, Dhaksha Prajapathi or creator. The father cursed the Moon and ordered that his effulgence should wane each day. The Moon, beloved of Lord Siva or the Supreme Being, ran to Him for succour and was counter-blessed to the effect that he should grow again and wax. Hence, for a fortnight the Moon wanes and for a fortnight waxes till she is full again. The natural phenomenon of the waxing and the waning of the Moon has been allegorically represented in this story and astrologically, the Moon is at her best in the constellations Krithika and Rohini. A prosaic or plain statement of the above would be that, in every lunar month, the Moon passes through the 27 constellations and during a circuit passes through all its phases waning from Full Moon to New Moon and again waxing from New Moon to Full Moon. The Moon is exalted in the constellations Krithika and Rohini.

A Similar Reading of the Previous Allegory About Rahu and Kethu

Rahu and Kethu are not independent planets like the Sun, the Moon, Mars, and others; they do not have different and independent orbits or periods; as two parts of one body, their movement is interrelated or joint; they are at all times at opposite points of the zodiac like the head and the tail; though they are by nature evil and are generally evil in influence, yet by association they are capable of doing good; by association with benefics, they turn beneficial; their juxtaposition with the Sun and the Moon cause eclipses.

Hindu Mythology and Rahu and Kethu

Hindu mythology has symbolically indicated the existence and nature of Rahu and Kethu. Except for a few who have ignored them, most of the ancient sages have divined their influences on the world and mankind. They have described them as "chayagrahas" or shadowy planets, meaning that they have no mass, shape, or substance and that they are celestial points on the Zodiac, with regulated movement and orbit, and that they have a distinct and predictable influence on horoscopes. The motion of these points is denoted and judged, so that their position at any particular moment can be calculated as accurately as the position of the Sun or the Moon, though owing to their nature being without substance, this cannot be verified by visual observation.

Westerners have named the two points Rahu and Kethu as Dragon's Head and Dragon's Tail, respectively, revealing their origin from Hindu Mythological tales. Western astrologers also refer to them as Caput and Cauda. These sensitive points are also called nodes, with the ascending node being Rahu and the descending node Kethu. To understand how these imaginary points are accurately located and their movements are calculated, we must consider the apparent paths in the Heavens of the two planets Sun and Moon. The Sun appears to move along an ellipse of which the Earth is a focus, and the plane of this ellipse is inclined to the terrestrial Equator at an angle of 23 degrees. The Moon, as the satellite of the Earth, moves round it and its path of this orbit is inclined to the Equator at an angle of 28 degrees, so that the planes of the orbits of the Sun and Moon appear to the observer on Earth to be inclined to each other at an angle of 5 degrees. When two circles cut each other, there are two points of interception. The two points at which the orbit of the Moon cuts the orbit of the Sun are called the nodes, and they are exactly 180 degrees apart. The point of intersection formed when the Moon's motion is from South to North is said to be the ascending node and named Rahu, and the point of interception formed when the Moon's motion is from North to South is called the descending node or Kethu. It has been observed in the zodiac at the rate of 19 degrees 0 minutes per year.

Naming of Rahu and Kethu

Solar and Lunar Eclipses
When the transit of the Sun and the Moon is close to the nodes, the Moon can intercept the light of the Sun from reaching the Earth, and thus cause a solar eclipse. The degree of proximity of the planets to the nodes determines the extent or size of the eclipse; when the Moon is within 5 degrees of the node on New Moon day, there will be either a total or annular eclipse of the Sun. If the New Moon is more than 5 degrees away from the node and the Sun is at the node, then we have a partial eclipse. When a full Moon is formed while the Moon is crossing the points of the nodes, the shadow of the Earth falls on the Moon and a lunar eclipse is the result. This too may be full or partial, according as the Sun is at the node or a little away from it.

Thus, the only apparent phenomena that can be connected with Rahu and Kethu are the eclipses when the Sun and the Moon are obscured by shadows. Hence, Hindu astrologers have called these "chaya grahas" or "shadow" planets.

The Nature and Influences of Rahu and Kethu in Predictive Astrology
We have seen that Rahu and Kethu are the points of the ecliptic where the plane of the Moon's orbit intersects the plane of the Sun's orbit. Let us now consider their nature and influences and what their place is in predictive astrology, according to Westerners and Hindu Sages.

Caput Draconis or Moon's North Node
The point of the zodiac where a planet crosses from south to north latitude is called the North Node, and vice versa, the South Node is called the descending node. The motion of the Moon's Node is retrograde, about 3' per day. The Sun, never crossing the ecliptic, has no node; and likewise the Earth which is considered as moving in the same plane as the Sun.
Westerners are of the opinion that Rahu is a benefic, whereas Kethu is a malefic. They do not take these nodes into consideration when predicting events in one's life or in mundane astrology.

According to the Hindus, Rahu and Kethu indicate one born in a low caste; one who may have intrigue with girls; one whose thoughts and actions will be evil; one who will resort to outcaste and low-born as well as ill-bred people. They are also said to be dissatisfied, fond of traveling, and like residences facing south. They may like to go to a mountain, a big jungle, or stay outside, and find pleasure in uttering falsehood, continuing to speak untruth, knowing fully well that they are lying. They will not mind to cohabit with quadrupeds or act like animals, and will be harsh in speech, looking downward while walking or talking with others. If a male, they will use an umbrella; if a lady, they will use a chowrie and an umbrella. Rahu and Kethu also affect the spleen, causing gas trouble and sharp acute pain. Buddhist, snake catchers, asses, rams, wolves, camels, serpents, poisonous insects, dark places, culex mosquitoes, bugs, insects, owls, etc., are said to belong to the nodes. Rahu denotes blackgram and Kethu indicates horsegram. For both the nodes, agate is the precious stone. (Phaladeebika).

Rahu Indicates Paternal Grandfather, Kethu Shows Maternal Grandfather
Both Nodes Can Cause Imprisonment
Rahu Is Attributed to Sinking with the Ship or Drowning, Pleasure with Diseased Women, Amputation, Leprosy, Giddiness, Wrestling, Life in a Cave, etc.
Kethu Is Attributed to Fear Complex, Insanity, Allergy, Leprosy, Injury, Fire Accident, Punishment from Government, Renunciation, Moksha, Wisdom After Sufferings and Bitter Experience, Weakness to Have Pleasure with Other Ladies.

Living in a rented house, enjoying life at others' expense, using others' vehicles, having an office car, taking one in adoption, danger to the offspring, pilgrimage, ill-health to the native, and defects to the children and vision are all judged from the position of Rahu and Kethu in one's horoscope.

Ownership of Houses by Rahu and Kethu

Rahu and Kethu do not own any of the twelve houses, as they are all distributed to the seven planets. However, some sages assign certain signs to the nodes as their owned houses, certain signs as their exalted houses, and the opposite signs as their debilitated houses, etc. These sages do not all agree with each other. For prediction, one can obtain accurate results without taking into consideration their ownership, exaltation, etc.

As Rahu and Kethu do not own any sign, they represent the lord of the sign. However, readers should note that Rahu or Kethu will act as a strong agent to the planet with which it is conjoined. If they are not conjoined with any planet, then they give the results of the planet which aspects them. Only when they are neither conjoined with, nor aspected by any planet, do they represent the lord of the house. This finding can be inferred from the following principle (Uthrakalamrita- Khanda VI Sloka 14 onwards.)

If Rahu or Kethu were to occupy the beneficial houses, 5 or 9, and if they are in conjunction with, or aspected by, the lord of the maraka houses, 2 or 7, then they cause death in their periods, even though the lord of the houses 5 and 9 produce Rajayoga.

If the nodes are in the maraka houses 2 or 7, they can cause danger to life. However, if they are conjoined with or aspected by the lords of 5 or 9, they do not cause death; instead, they increase one's wealth, improve one's health and contribute to a long life. But if the lords of 5 or 9 are conjoined with either of the nodes or if they aspect them, they can cause death.

Therefore, Rahu and Kethu offer the results of the planets with which they are conjoined, or those by which they are aspected, or the ruler of the sign in which they are posited.

If Rahu or Kethu were to be in Gemini, Mithuna, Virgo, Kanni, Sagittarius, Dhanus, or Pisces, Meena, conjoined with the lord of the 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, or 10th house, then the person will enjoy life, gain wealth, and become influential during their periods and sub-periods.

If Rahu and Kethu were to be in a dual rasi, as mentioned above, and if it is conjoined with, or aspected by, any of the lords of the houses 6, 8, or 12, then the person will not receive much benefit in their periods, but they may lose any elder member of the family belonging to their paternal or maternal side.

If Rahu or Kethu were to occupy an evil house, but they are conjoined with the lords of Kendra or Kona house, they cannot produce beneficial results. However, some other scholars say that the nodes can bring fortune even if they are in evil houses. Kalidas does not mention with whom he agrees. He continues to say that Rahu and Kethu will cause harm to the person if they occupy evil houses, even though they may be conjoined with benefics.

If Rahu or Kethu occupy the houses 6, 8, or 12 and receive an aspect from any of the three lords or are conjoined with any of them, then the native will suffer during their dasas.

If Rahu or Ketu are in 6, 8, or 12 and are conjoined with or aspected by the lords of 2 or 7, they affect the native's longevity.

If Rahu or Kethu were to be in either 6th, 8th, or 12th house and if they are connected with the lords of Kendra or Kona houses (1, 4, 7, 10; 1, 5, 9), then the native will enjoy beneficial results during the sub period of such a lord. However, they may suffer from disease, undergo various difficulties, meet with accidents, and either succumb to such injuries or commit suicide or be drowned during the sub period of the lord of 6th, 8th, or 12th house.

If Rahu or Ketu occupy the houses 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, or 10, and if Rajayoga planets conjoin or aspect the nodes, one can expect happiness, health, wealth, children, power, prosperity, and comfortable conveyance during their periods.

According to Kalidasa, Rahu is exalted in Taurus (Vrishaba) and debilitated in Scorpio (Vrischika), while the opposite is true for Kethu. Rahu owns Aquarius (Rumba), and Kethu rules Scorpio (Vrischika). The Moola-trikona sign of Rahu is Gemini (Mithuna), while that of Kethu is Virgo (Kanni). Leo (Simha) and Cancer (Kataka) are the enemy signs of Rahu and Kethu, while Libra (Thulam) and Capricorn (Makara) are their friendly signs. Aries (Mesha) and Sagittarius (Dhanus) are neutral signs for both.

Shri Ramadayalu Sanketanidhi states that Gemini (Mithuna) is the exaltation sign of Rahu and Virgo (Kanni) is the Swakshetra or the sign ruled by Rahu. Sagittarius (Dhanus) is the sign of exaltation of Kethu and Pisces (Meena) is owned by Kethu. Saturn (Sani) is also mentioned.

Some astrologers believe that Scorpio (Vrischika) is the exaltation sign of Rahu and Aquarius is the sign of exaltation of Kethu. However, due to the confusion and contradiction between authors, it is best for new students to leave this topic alone. Kalidasa states that Rahu and Kethu are very strong when exalted. Rahu is beneficial when it is in any of the houses 4, 7, 9, 10, or 11, while Kethu is favourable if it is in the 3rd house.

Again, Another Doubt Arises Among the Students:
Putradhosha

What is said that Rahu and Kethu are always 180 degrees away from each other? If Rahu is in the 11th house, then Kethu must be in the 5th house. It is said that Rahu in 11 gives many children, whereas Kethu in 5 threatens loss of children, stillborn children, or abortion. Does this not appear to be funny? No, Rahu in 11 will protect the children during its dasa and its sub-periods, whereas Kethu in 5 will affect health or cause abortion during its period and sub-period. Any planet indicating any result can offer such during its period and sub-period. Rahu's beneficial result cannot be cancelled by Kethu's malefic ones and vice versa; each will operate separately in their respective periods.

Findings of Hindu Sages Regarding the Effects of Relative Positions of Rahu and Other Planets
Several authors have discussed the results to be expected due to certain relative positions of Rahu and other planets. For example, Mars, Rahu, and Saturn in the 8th house can deprive one of their nostrils; Mars in 6, Rahu in 7, and Saturn in 8 can cause loss of partner and independent life; Venus in 2, Moon in 1, Mercury and Sun in 12, and Rahu in 5 can involve one in murder and punish them with imprisonment; if Rahu is in 7 and is strong, the complexion of the partner will be black; Rahu in the 7th house reduces the strength of the fecundity in the female to nothing; Saturn and Rahu in 7 can cause hysteria; Mercury and Rahu in 6 can cause typhoid; Venus, Saturn, and Rahu can cause venereal disease; Jupiter and Rahu can cause surgical treatment for birth control; Mars, Saturn, and Rahu can cause accidents; and Sun and Rahu can indicate difficulties through government officials, litigation, loss of profession and prestige, worry, anxiety, and inferiority complex, among other things.

Rahu or Kethu Will Prove Beneficial

If they are conjoined with or aspected by the lords of beneficial houses, or if they occupy the constellation and sub of the planets owning favourable houses, i.e., for one born in the ascendant Capricorn, Venus is a benefic by owning the 10th house. Hence, Rahu will prove to be a benefic if it is conjoined with or aspected by Venus, or if Rahu occupies the constellations belonging to Venus, i.e., Bharani, Poorvapalguni, and Poorvashada, or the sub of Venus which will extend to 2 degrees 13 minutes 20 seconds in each constellation. The same principle applies to Kethu also.

Rahu in the constellation of the lords of 6, 8, and 12 will produce undesirable results, even though the house (solar mansion and bhava) may be considered as beneficial. Upachayasaana. Similarly, Rahu or Kethu will do the greatest evil, causing death to the person in its period or sub-period if it is in the constellation of the planet in Bhadhaksthana, or if it is in that of the owner of the Bhadhakasthana, or in any manner connected with Kendhradipathi, or occupies the constellation of the lords of 2 and 7, or is conjoined with, or aspected by them.

Suppose one is born in Thula Lagna (Libra Ascendant) - as it is a movable sign, the 11th sign is Bhadhakasthana. If there is any planet in Leo, Simha the 11th sign, then note the constellation of the occupant. If Mars is in 11, then Rahu in Mrigasirisha, Chithra, or Dhanishta will prove to be evil, whether it is in the 8th, 9th, 12th, 1st, 4th, or 5th house counted from Lagna. It is found that one passes away in Rahu's sub or sub-period, irrespective of the house it occupies. If there is no planet in Bhadhakasthana, then take the lord of that house. In this example, Leo is the Bhadhakasthana and its lord is Sun. Hence, Rahu in Sun's sub or in any of the three constellations of Sun, Karthikai, Uthrapalguni, or Uthrashada will definitely prove to be a Maraka. Thus, one is to judge, when alone correct prediction can be offered.

Rahu and Kethu are Stronger than Other Planets
Suppose Venus and Rahu are conjoined in Pisces, Libra, or Taurus. Even if Venus is exalted, Vargothamamsa, or occupying either the day house or night house, Rahu will predominate and offer the results of Venus to a greater extent than Venus itself. If Venus is the significator, then Rahu takes its effect and acts as a strong significator of the matter in one's horoscope.
If the lord of 2, 6, or 10 is conjoined with or aspects Rahu or Kethu, then the node so connected will indicate one's profession and one will get into service during the node's sub-periods if the lord of the constellation is also a significator.
If the lord of 2, 7, or 11 or the planets in 2, 7, or 11 aspect Rahu or Kethu, marriage will be celebrated in Rahu's sub-periods, provided the lord of the constellation is also a significator.
Rahu or Kethu in 2, 5, or 11, receiving good aspects, will give children in their periods and sub-periods in any of the following stars: Arudhra (Mercury and Rahu periods), Swathi (Venus and Rahu periods), Aswini (Kethu and Mars), Makam (Sun and Kethu), Moolam (Jupiter and Kethu).
Thus, it can be seen that Rahu and Kethu are much stronger than the planets conjoined with them or the lord of the sign in which either of them is posited.

Rahu and Kethu are declared to be evil by Hindu sages. However, it is a fact that they are not always evil; under certain circumstances, they can prove to be more auspicious than any other planet. If Rahu or Kethu is in the constellation of the lords of beneficial houses and is conjoined with or aspected by benefics by lordship, they will offer the most favourable and agreeable results.

If Rahu or Ketu are in a sign, they will give the results of not only the matters signified by that house and sign, but also the matters indicated by the other sign ruled by the same lord. Except for the Sun and Moon, each of the other planets rules two signs, so the nodes will offer the results of both signs.

Rahu and Kethu are to be taken as the agents of the lord of the sign, the lord of the star, and the lord of the sub. They are capable of producing the results caused by the combination of the sign lord, star lord, and sub lord. For example, if a person has Rahu in Taurus at 26-36, it is in Venus' sign Taurus, Mars' star Mrigasirisha, and Jupiter's sub. This offers one the job of a manager in an automobile industry in Rahu Dasa, Jupiter sub period, Venus sub sub, and Mars shukashma. The results of Rahu and Kethu are invariably modified by the lords of the constellations, sign, and sub.

Rahu in the Constellation of Sun

Rahu is in the constellation of Sun, i.e., Karthikai, Uthrapalguni or Uthrashada. High fever, heart disease, giddiness, enmity, quarrels, unpleasant domestic environments, fear, suspicion of the partner, lack of trust in anyone, changes in occupation and residence, suffering from contagious diseases, and mental unrest are indicated, especially when Sun rules over evil houses. However, if Sun is a Rajayogadhipathi, promotion, reputation, name, fame, cessation of enmity, and charity are indicated.

Rahu in the Constellation of Moon, i.e., Rohini, Hastham, or Sravanam, indicates success in agriculture, a good crop, the purchase of cows, an increase in income, a pleasant life, life with kith and kin, sea voyages, and the purchase of wet lands. However, if Moon is afflicted or ill-posited, or if it owns evil houses, it threatens danger by drowning, trouble with micturition, a change of residence and transfer, loss or danger to the wife, pain and swelling in the limbs, injury to the person, mental worries, and anxieties.

Rahu in the Constellation of Mars, i.e., Mrigasirisha, Chithra, or Dhanishta, Threatens Loss by Fire, Theft, or Robbery; Loss in Litigation; Loss of Money; Difficulties; Sorrow; Open Inimical Activity; Fondness for Easy and Dissolute Habits; Disputes; Irritation; Rash Action; Violence; Disharmony with Partner; Calamities; Failure of Memory; Danger from Officials, Government, the Police, and Military, etc.; Chances for Imprisonment, etc. If Mars is a Benefic, Service in Jail Department and Other Favourable and Agreeable Results are Indicated.

Rahu in Mercury's Constellation: Ashlesha, Jyeshta, or Revathi

This indicates that one will have a large number of acquaintances, friends, and benefactors; they will be fond of frequent travels; they will earn satisfactorily in many ways and save much; they will gain royal favor; they will come in contact with strangers and enter into agreements with them; they will lead a happy life and have many children; they will purchase conveyances and gain through business agency. 

If Mercury is the lord of an evil house, the person will be a fraud, will give their word easily to everybody but never keep it or fulfill it; they will appear outwardly to be honest but inwardly be cunning and a cheat, so enemies will increase in number because of their own actions; they will never hesitate to utter falsehood or commit forgery; they will suffer from Vitamin B deficiency and typhoid.

Rahu in the Constellation of Jupiter, Punarvasu, Visakham, or Poorvapathrapada, if Jupiter rules beneficial houses, promises that the enmity will come to an end. One can come out victorious at elections, win in litigation, enjoy the good-will of government servants, acquire wealth, have the birth of children, increase pleasure, gain influence and position through persons in power, have good relationships with politicians, benefit from superiors, have success in all efforts, have happy celebrations in the family, and visit holy places and take dips in sacred rivers.

Persons will purchase vehicles and costly articles, fancy ones, and good furniture, on hire purchase or will import them. They will have good relationships with relatives, especially ladies, and will acquire wealth and compromise. They will have friendly alliances, gain advantages from superiors, and have promotion and popularity. Marriage and the birth of children are also likely.

Rahu in the constellation of the malefic Saturn, i.e., in Pushyam, Anuradha, or Uthrattadhi, threatens ill-repute, injury by the person falling down or something falling on the person, bad association, and misunderstanding with a partner. It may even lead to divorce. There will be incessant contests and disputes, disease due to wind and bile, depressing correspondence, distress among relatives, helplessness among friends and well-wishers, and a removal of residence to an unfrequented, remote place with a preference for seclusion.

Rahu in its own constellation, Arudhra, Swathi, or Sathabisha, will cause disturbances in the mind such as anxieties, petty quarrels, misunderstandings with relatives, death of elders or partner in life, danger of poisoning, transfer to undesirable quarters, all varieties of scandal and ill-repute, ill-health, pain in joints, bites of insects, injury, having to attend court as a witness, failure of intellect, and loss of wealth. However, if it is in the sub of a benefic, one can become the head of the family, enjoy life, receive promotion, and visit foreign places, etc.

Rahu in Kethu's Constellation:

Rahu in Kethu's constellation, i.e. in Aswini, Makham or Moolam, can threaten confusion, contradiction, danger from insects, fractures, piles, fistula, untimely meals, susceptibility to infectious diseases, ill-health to the members of the family, troubles through partner in life, enmity with superiors, loss of money, prestige, honour, etc., loss of children, death of pet animals and cattle, and misfortune of all kinds. However, if Kethu is well-posited in the horoscope, it can indicate the purchase of costly jewels, marriage, promotion, ownership of a building or car, starting of a business, and the birth of a child.

Ketu in Sun's Constellation, i.e., in Karthikai, Uthrapalguni, or Uthrashada, is indicated to cause bodily pain, disappointment in attempts, danger, blood poisoning, cardiac trouble, obstacles in profession, disagreement with superiors, enmity, troubles in one's service, sickness to paternal relatives, long journeys, separation from family members, unfavourable Government orders, and loss in speculation.

Ketu in Moon's Constellation, i.e., in Rohini, Hastham or Sravanam Star: Mental Depression, Disputes, Worry about Fair Sex, Trouble through Daughters and Mother, Cold Pleurisy, Bronchitis, Pneumonia, T.B., Loss of Relatives and Money. However, if Moon owns Good Houses (Bhavas), one will have both Social and Financial Success.

No More Evil-End of Troubles

Kethu in Mercury's constellation, i.e. Ashlesha, Jyeshta, or Revathi, brings no more evil-end of troubles, reunion with relatives, favourable friends, no anxiety, no jealousy, no deception, gain of knowledge, probation, training, long journey, marriage, entering into contract, and a new cycle of pleasant life.

Benefits of Kethu in Jupiter's Constellation

Their wife's health will be indifferent, they may own a comfortable conveyance, and they will pray to the Goddess who crowns them with success. They will redeem jewels and other pledged articles, and overdraft facilities will no longer be needed.

Ketu in Saturn's Constellation, i.e., Pushyam, Anuradha, or Uthrapathrapada Star: Loss of close relatives, trouble from enemies, danger of imprisonment, loss of money, sale of property, loss through floods, failure of agriculture, heavy loss in all ways, change of residence, litigation with landlord, cutaneous disease, mental anguish, disagreement with relatives, running away from the house, and secret activities with servant maids.

Losses and Disagreements

Ketu in Rahu's constellation, i.e., Arudhra, Swathi, or Sathabhisha, can lead to the sale of possessions, litigation, chances for imprisonment, disputes with friends, loss of prestige, loss of power and property, punishment by the government, loss by theft, failure of business, adultery with low-class ladies, ill-repute, reversion in service, and reversals of attempts, and disappointment.ened.

If Kethu is in its own constellation, i.e. in Aswini, Makam or Moolam, there may be confusion, worries, much loss, delay, separation, estrangement, bereavement, blood poisoning, depression, etc. However, if Kethu is in a good house and its lord is also well posited, the evil effects will be lessened.

## URANUS (HERSCHEL)

The Discovery of Uranus

Nobody can state with authority who discovered the planets Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn, which are visible to the naked eye and which wander in the zodiac. No skill is needed to note the Sun and Moon, as one cannot miss them. Westerners are of the opinion that Mr. Seth was the first to divide the zodiac into 12 equal parts, and literature shows that ancient Chinese, Mayas, and Incas of South America, the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Egyptians, and others had realized the existence of these planets. (Probably, a week is distributed to these 7 planets, and there are 7 days in the week.)
But the Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed, was the first person to notice, between 1690 and 1715, on more than six occasions, the existence of Uranus. Later, a musician called Herschel discovered this planet and, according to the suggestion of Mr. Bode, he gave the name Uranus to this new planet. It is also named after him as "Herschel". Uranus is about 1782 million miles away from the Sun. The greater the distance from the Sun, the slower will be the movement in the zodiac. Therefore, Uranus is a slow-moving planet. It takes about 84 years to go around the Sun once. Its diameter is about 32,000 miles.
Since Uranus was not known to the ancient astrologers of India, there is no name in Sanskrit or any other Indian language for Uranus. A few beginners of astrology mistake Uranus as either Rahu or Kethu, and a few call it "Indra" without any authority.
Both the Westerners and the Hindus originally knew only 7 planets from the Sun to Saturn, and both allotted the 12 signs of the Zodiac to these 7 planets. The Sun and Moon were given Leo and Cancer, each only one sign, whereas the other five planets were allotted two signs each.
After Discovering Uranus, Westerners Considered That Uranus Governs the Central Nervous System and Offers Supreme Intelligence and Research Mind or Perverted Ideas

Uranus Causes Sudden Unexpected Results, Including Death. It Is Allotted Aquarius-Kumba, an Airy Sign. Sudden Death Is Due to Heart Failure, and Aquarius Is Opposed to the Sign Indicating the Heart, Leo. Therefore, Aquarius Is Allotted to Both Saturn and Uranus. It Is Not Established in Which Sign Uranus Will Be Exalted and Where It Will Be Debilitated, But Virgo-Kanni Is Allotted as the Sign of Exaltation to Uranus, as Long as Uranus Controls the Intelligence of a Native and Also the Nervous System.

Physical Features

Generally, those who have grown very tall will have a favourable connection of Uranus with the ascendant (one should not take the whole Lagna bhava for aspects, only the cusp should be taken). Further, Uranus in the signs Gemini, Aquarius, Sagittarius, and Leo will produce unusually tall persons. Uranus occupying the ascendant or forming a good aspect with the Lagna gives long limbs and a slender body. It will also give deep-set, penetrative eyes and good vision. However, if it afflicts the second cusp and also the planets Venus and Sun, it can cause a defect in the vision.

Diseases

If Uranus is in the ascendant or in the 6th house and forms an unfavourable aspect with the Sun, one may have heart trouble or epilepsy. Uranus in Aries can cause injuries to the head and headaches on one side, as well as difficulty sleeping. It is likely that the person will nod their head unknowingly and frequently. Uranus in Taurus can cause sore throats, swellings, mumps, and if it afflicts Mercury and the 2nd cusp, one may lose their voice. Uranus in Gemini can produce pneumonia, bronchial afflictions, asthma, hiccoughs, and coughs. Uranus in Cancer can give dyspepsia, fractures of the ribs, and ulcers in the breasts. Uranus in Leo can affect the vertebral column, spine, and heart. Uranus in Virgo can cause disorders in the digestive system and produce ulcers, as well as making the person feel as though they are suffering from some disease. A few may even experience electric shock. Uranus in Libra can represent inflammation of the kidneys, as well as stones in the bladder, diabetes, and pains in the hips. Uranus in Scorpio can cause hernias, hydroceles, diseases in the generative system, piles, and fistulas. Uranus in Sagittarius can threaten danger from animals, as well as tetanus, hydrophobia, injuries from falling off animals, and fractures of the hip and thigh. Uranus in Capricorn can cause rheumatism, dislocations, and fractures. Uranus in Aquarius can indicate suffocation, heart failure, and death due to poisonous gas. Finally, Uranus in Pisces can cause fractures, lameness, amputations, scurvy, scabies, or eczema.

Characteristics of Uranus

The advancement of science is generally signified by Uranus. Hence, people having Uranus strongly posited in their chart will be always after study, thinking, and contemplation. They are best suited for doing research and uncovering the truth. They do not want to simply follow traditions without convincing themselves. They will be inclined to study occultism and mesmerism; they gain such knowledge to heal diseases by their mental will, telepathy, television, electricity, astrology and other related studies. Those people with strong Uranus will have accurate intuition, keen foresight, quick action and constructive criticism. 
Uranus gives an independent spirit, original thought and speedy turnover. In love affairs, unless Uranus has beneficial aspects, the persons having strong Uranus with adverse aspects, will neither abide by law nor convention. They have their own law. It does not take them long to fall in love with one and neglect the other sex and also to divorce in no time, regardless of the law, morality and man-made rules. But a good aspect to Uranus makes one a builder of a society to do good and give lift to the associates. People who arrange marriages in their own way are usually not conventional, they do not mind what others feel or say. In their horoscopes, Uranus need not be afflicted. Mars may be a strong benefic. 
The most eccentric person would be one in whose horoscope Uranus and Mercury have adverse aspects.

Avoid Self-Destructive Actions

One should not entertain false ideas of independence; never be perverse either in thought or speech. Avoid violence and other self-destructive actions. Though one may prefer abrupt changes, it is advisable to judge properly whether it will bring any reversion and misfortune.

## Neptune
Neptune is the eighth giant planet. It is far away in space and cannot be seen without the aid of a powerful telescope. On average, it is 2,793 million miles from the Sun and has a diameter of about 27,600 miles. It weighs about 17 times the Earth. It was discovered by Mr. Galle and Challis in 1846. It revolves around the Zodiac in about 1461/2 years. As Neptune has not yet completed one round since its position in its orbit was fixed in 1846, the nature of Neptune, its influence on animate and inanimate objects, and the modifications while it transits in each sign have not yet been fixed. However, regular and systematic observation of the general nature of Neptune has been assessed in some way.

Neptune is the octave of Mercury, while Uranus is that of Venus. Uranus acts on the love-nature, while Neptune works on the spiritual side. Mercury governs the brains, improving the intellect of people and lifting them above animals, making them human; but Neptune improves spirituality and makes them divine.

As there are only twelve houses in the Zodiac and they had been allotted to the seven planets prior to the discovery of Uranus and Neptune, there is no separate house for them. However, considering its nature, Neptune is said to govern the sign Pisces (Meena), as the Greeks consider Neptune as the Poseidon king of the sea.

Neptune offers psychic-ability, feelings, inspiration, and emotion. It gives the power to foresee and increases one's passion. One may practice and try to have clairvoyance or crystal-gazing, hypnotism, mesmerism, thought-reading, or spiritual development, or to control devils or act as a medium with the spirit. It gives imagination and is thus beneficial to poets, musicians, artists, and painters. Neptune makes one dreamy, imaginative, or learn black-magic or be religious, paradoxical, impressionable, or make one an extreme in love affairs, secret attachments, or stealthily having pleasure with strange characters. It is difficult to understand people who are governed by Neptune.

If Neptune is afflicted, one will not be steady, always fond of changes, not reliable, confused, cynical, and treacherous. They will think of evil alone, conspire, and try to do harm to others. They may even commit murder by giving an overdose of drugs, poison, narcotics, or opium.

Neptune's Governance of the Body

Neptune governs the nervous system, retina, optic nerves, cerebro-spinal fluid, and more.

Diseases: Eye Trouble, Brain Dysfunction, Coma, Catalepsy, Trance, Mental Disturbances, Insanity, Dropsy, Narcotic Poisoning, Leprosy, Allergies, Neurasthenia, etc.

Profession: Astrologer, Magician, Clairaudient, Crystal-Gazer, Philosopher, Spiritual Teacher, Poet, Musician, Instrumentalist, Dramatist, Cinematographer, Artist, Painter, Druggist, Dealer in Narcotics, Tobacco, Opium, Gas Plants, Aviation, Navigation, Shipping, Shipyard, Fisheries, Prohibition, Drinks, Liquor, Hospital Service, Asylum Service, Prison Service, Tea Estate Service, Petrol Mine Service, Oil Service, and Dealing in Chloroform, Ether, Artificial Silk, and Beverages.

Places: Neptune Governs Aviation, Navigation, Port-Trust, Customs, Excise, Fisheries, Liquor, Narcotic Drugs, Hospitals, Prisons, Asylums, Secret Organizations, Refugee Camps, Famine Centers, and Communism.

## Fortuna
Fortuna, also known as Pars Fortuna, is the most sensitive and fortunate point in the Zodiac. It moves at a speed much faster than the Moon, and its position is calculated by adding the longitude of the Moon counted from Aries Zero to the longitude of the Ascendant counted from Aries Zero, and then subtracting the longitude of the Sun counted from Aries Zero. This is equivalent to adding the Thithi to the lagna. The position of Fortuna can be found in an Ephemeris, but it varies every moment and moves about one degree within a period of four minutes.

Calculating the Position of Fortuna
When calculating the position of Fortuna, we take into account the ascendant, the Moon, and the Sun, as these three move faster than the other planets. Therefore, births within very short intervals will have the position of Fortuna in different longitudes. For those born around New Moon day, Fortuna is found in the Ascendant; for Sukla Thiruthiyai-born, it will be in the 2nd house; for Sukla Panchami in the third house; and for Sukla Paksha Saptami in the 4th house, and so on. For people born on Full Moon day, Fortuna will be in the 7th house. For all people born during Suklapaksha, Fortuna will be found in the houses 1 to 7, whereas for all people born in Krishna Paksha, Fortuna will be found between the 7th and 12th houses.

In Our Experience, Fortuna Deserves Serious Attention, as It Indicates Certain Results Which Are Not So Clearly Shown by the Aspects Formed by the Transiting Planets to Those in the Natal Chart.

It has been found that the results enjoyed by people born within a few minutes of each other can be diametrically opposite. Therefore, one must try to find out what moves so quickly as to create such different effects. It is true that the ascendant, the meridian, and Fortuna are the three that move very quickly and they alone can provide the correct clues for different results within a short period for the same person, or diametrically opposite results for people born within a short interval in the same latitude and longitude. Consequently, one should not neglect to include Fortuna when constructing a chart and making predictions.

The Effects of Fortuna on the Chart

Fortuna improves the matters signified by the house in which it is located in the chart. As per progression, when benefics form favourable aspects to Fortuna, one will be lucky to have the matters of the house, occupied by Fortuna, enjoyed to the satisfaction of the native. However, planets owning bad houses forming good aspects give adverse results, while evil aspects offer favourable results. Beneficial planets forming evil aspects with Fortuna cause undesirable effects. Similarly, during transits, one is to predict the beneficial nature or the adverse ones according to the aspects formed to Fortuna. Yoga-adhiipathis transiting the position of Fortuna bring unexpected advantages, as Fortuna represents worldly success.

Fortuna and Longevity
Fortuna has nothing to do with longevity. This is because for twins born in the same sign as the Lagna on a New Moon day, or for people born on a New Moon day, Fortuna will be in the Lagna. It is not uncommon for some of these individuals to have short lifespans. There are instances where children born on the New Moon day die in infancy or at any age. Therefore, even though Fortuna is considered to be a beneficial point and the Lagna contributes to long life, Fortuna has nothing to do with longevity.

Similarly, a person's characteristics are not influenced by Fortuna, even though the first house is considered for characteristics. However, Fortuna in the Lagna promises that the person will be fortunate, will gain in their enterprises, lead a happy life, come up by their own efforts and industry, work with confidence, and have a brilliant and successful career.
