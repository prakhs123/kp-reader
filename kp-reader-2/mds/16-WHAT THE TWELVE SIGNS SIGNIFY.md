## What the Twelve Signs Signify
The physical features, characteristics, marks, health, finance, and profession indicated by each sign are dealt with in general. Planets occupying these signs will modify these results. Only when there is no planet in the sign can the effect of these be noticed without any deviation. The qualities of the sign will be manifest all the more if its lord were also to be posited therein. Like a coin which has two different sides, each sign presents two characteristics - good and bad. Depending on other factors, these characteristics will be modified. Benefics like Jupiter and Venus in the Ascendant mitigate the evil and offer more agreeable results. Malefics like Saturn and Mars in the Ascendant spoil the good nature and bring out the worst qualities into action. Similarly, the general physical features indicated by each sign may vary from the normal, due largely to the planets occupying the sign.

### Aries - Mesha
Aries - Mesha is the first or head sign of the Zodiac. It commences at the vernal equinox and extends up to exactly 30 degrees. Aries is an equinoctial sign. It is fiery and hot by nature, termed bestial and sterile. It is a movable or cardinal sign, masculine or positive, and is of short ascension. Aries is generally symbolized by a Ram, being in nature rash, combative, lascivious, springy, and hardy. It is called an Oriental sign denoting the beginning of the Right Ascension. Aries represents head and face in the human body and is ruled by Mars. The Sun is exalted in this sign, while Saturn is debilitated and Venus is said to be in its fall in this sign, as it is the 7th sign opposing Libra owned by Venus. According to the Sayana system, the Sun enters Aries on 21st or 22nd March, while according to the Nirayana system, the Sun enters on 13th or 14th April.
#### Physical Appearance
Persons born under this sign are of middle stature, with a lean and muscular body, neither stout nor thick. Their complexion is ruddy and they have a fairly long neck and face. Their head is broad at the temples and narrow at the chin, with bushy eyebrows, eyes grey to greyish brown with sharp sight, and wiry hair varying from dark to sandy.
#### Mental Tendencies
As Mars rules this sign, the people born in Aries will be ever active and ambitious, bold and impulsive. If the ascendant is afflicted, they will be rash and aggressive, but beneficial aspects give them confidence and courage. They always aim high and are ever enterprising.
#### Characteristics
Aries, being the first sign of the zodiac, persons born under this sign will desire to be at the head of all affairs. They do not relish suggestions from others but act only according to their own judgment. They do not like subordination but wish to be the leaders in thought and action. They are best fitted to guide, control, and govern others if the ascendant receives beneficial aspects. Being a positive sign, it gives determination and force of character. Arians act quickly with unbounded self-confidence. They have much of executive ability and uncompromising spirit. Being born in a movable sign, they will not hesitate to change whatever they dislike and whenever they want. They cannot wait patiently for opportunities to come but will go out and create them to fulfill their desire. As Aries is a fiery sign, their mind will be pregnant with ideas and their desire will be to execute them at once. They are best fitted to deal with any situation or emergency. They can never sacrifice their personal desires for others. If the sign is afflicted, the Aries born will be drawn into a quarrel and if they do not fare well, they become fretful and boisterous. They will try to stick to their own views, under-estimate others, be over-optimistic, overshoot the mark, and over-trade in business. They are not the people who look before they leap. Consistency is not their virtue. They will take up fresh enterprises before completing those on hand. Even if they occupy a humble and subordinate position, they will try to be at the head of some branch of their work. Very quickly they scheme, plan, and execute with the ultimate object of directing others. If Aries is afflicted, the native's enthusiasm is converted into fanaticism, and boldness into foolhardiness. They are ardently demonstrative and passionate. Evil planets in the ascendant make them aggressive, proud, arrogant, headstrong, hasty, and quarrelsome. They will be egoistic with the 'I' predominating in them. They are tenacious and purposeful, with their accent on the ends and not on the means.
#### Health and Disease
Generally, people born under the sign of Aries will enjoy good health. They will have a strong immunity to and resistance against infectious diseases, as Mars rules the sign. However, they are prone to minor injuries and serious accidents, particularly to the head, so they should exercise caution when engaging in activities that involve risk, such as driving cars or working with sharp instruments. Both men and women born in this sign will be fond of sports, as they are capable of sudden spurts of energy. They are better suited for games that last only a few minutes than for matches that last for a long duration.  
Aries indicates the head, and the sixth house from it is Virgo, which denotes the digestive system and the type of ailments that Aries-born people are likely to suffer from. These include headaches, burns, inflammatory diseases, affections of the brain, neuralgia, coma, high fever, colic pains, paralysis, apoplexy, pimples, insomnia, ringworms, migraine, smallpox, malaria, affections of the brain, thrombosis, etc. To maintain good health, Aries-born people should get plenty of rest and sleep, eat good food with plenty of vegetables, relax, and control their feelings. They should also avoid worry, excitement, and anger. As a patient, the native becomes impatient of sickness and tries to have a quick recovery. They should also avoid stimulants and eat less meat.  
Aries indicates the bones of the skull and face, except the nasal one, as well as the muscles such as occipitals, deprimens articularum, buccinator, frontals, attolens, temporates, and zygomaticus. It also represents the internal carotids and temporal carotids arteries, as well as the cephalic veins.  
#### Finance and Fortune
Though people born in this sign are not inclined to amass wealth, they still have a desire to earn a lot and spend accordingly. They may lose money through impulsive purchases and rash investments, as they tend to think only of the present and not of the future. If there are evil planets in Aries, they may start something in a flash and end in a crash. To avoid this, they should think before they act and balance their budgets.
#### Romance and Marriage
Arians are very frank and enthusiastic in love. Their good nature and charm attract the opposite sex, and they take practical steps to pursue their interests. They want freedom, adventure, and everlasting affection in love. To be happy, they should soften their dominant nature and not be impatient or emotional. They should also stick with their old lover.  
Aries wives will be witty and independent. If Aries is afflicted, they will have pride in their appearance and in their domestic environment. They will always speak highly of their own family. Jealousy and pride are their outstanding weaknesses, and they will expect their husbands to attend to them, speak highly of them, and never praise anyone else, especially in their presence. They will prove to be good hosts, and they will only love a man whom they can admire. If an Aries lady marries a simple man, she will overpower and subdue him in all activities. Therefore, husbands should be patient and tactful when dealing with them. Aries women become very romantic and are prone to sudden spurts of enthusiasm. Husbands born under Leo or Sagittarius will be able to cope with Aries ladies, while Libra-borns will tone down the fiery nature of Aries natives and purchase peace at any price.  
Aries husbands will prove to be desirable partners. They usually choose beautiful, clever, and good wives. When in a good mood, they will be generous and bountiful. However, they may make impulsive purchases on credit without any planning or money on hand. Therefore, those who marry Aries-borns should always save a portion of what the husbands give them.  
#### Domestic Environment
People born in Aries love their home and family. They strive to keep their house neat and tidy and are excellent hosts. They have many friends who often visit and keep them cheerful.
#### Profession
Aries indicates professions that are ruled by Mars. If the planet that denotes one's profession by owning either the 2nd, 6th, or 10th house in one's horoscope occupies Aries in Rasi, or if the lord of the house occupies Aries in Navamsa, or if Aries happens to be the second, sixth, or tenth house and the lord Mars is very strong, then the native may pursue any of the following professions: army officers, captains in the army or navy, soldiers, defense department, surgeons, butchers, barbers, police, A.R.P. officials, chemists, bailiffs, thieves, smiths, tailors, cutlers, bakers, armorers, watchmakers, dyers, cooks, carpenters, gamesters, gunners, physicians, boxers, workers in iron and steel, officers of law, firemen, guards, detectors, mechanics, wrestlers, workers in lime and brick kilns, dealers in sports goods, writers, workers in factories, industry, and mills, etc.

### Taurus (Rishaba)
Taurus is the second sign of the zodiac and extends from 30 degrees of the Vernal Equinox (or Mesha) to 60 degrees. It is contained in the Karthikai Nakshathra (or constellation) in the second, third, and fourth padas (quarters), and in the Rohini Nakshathra in full and the first and second padas of Mrigasirisha. Taurus is an earthy, fixed, feminine, moist, semi-fertile, bestial sign of short ascension. It is symbolized by a bull, both by Hindus and Westerners, with unusual horns on its head and toes, and a decisive and determined look to go ahead and rush forward with great energy, showing its stubborn and tenacious nature.  
A few thousand years ago, the Egyptians celebrated the May Day festival, likely due to the entrance of the Sun into Taurus, which is referred to as "The Sacred Bull," and when the Vernal Equinox coincided with the commencement of Taurus. The May Day festival with its Maypole and garlands may be their remains. Taurus is governed by Venus (Sukra), who is said to be the owner of this sign. It is also the sign where the Moon is exalted. As Taurus is the seventh sign from Scorpio, ruled by Mars (Mangal-Kuja-Sevvai-Angaraka), it is the house of detriment to Mars. The fiery nature of Mars is toned down by the passionate and peaceful Venus (Sukra).  
#### Physical Features
People with Taurus as their sign typically have a middle stature, a plump body, a broad forehead, a thick and stout neck, bright eyes, dark hair, a clear complexion, and are solidly built and stocky with big shoulders and well-developed muscles.
#### Characteristics
Taurus is the first of the earthy triplicity and the first of the fixed signs. Being earthy by nature, Taureans can put up with a lot of provocation and are known for their patience. When provoked to anger, however, they become wild with rage and can be dangerous like an earthquake. They are slow and steady, plodding and persevering, patient and persistent, enduring and executive, and conservative. They have a strong will and are determined and dogmatic. When this house is afflicted, they may have vices such as laziness and self-indulgence.  
Taureans have a sharp eye on their money and worldly possessions, and an impelling appetite for food. They concentrate their thoughts and have immense power and will. They prefer ease, comfort, and feasts, and live in their feelings rather than in their minds.  
As Venus rules this sign, the person will be ambitious and cheerful, ever smiling, and highly diplomatic. They may come upon a legacy at any part of their life, and be blessed with ornaments, costly jewels, gems, furniture, conveyance, comforts, estates, and gardens. They prefer solitude and rural life if Saturn lends its assistance. They are straightforward and natural, and do not jump to conclusions without considering the pros and cons. They are not verbose, and hold fast to their own opinions. They need more speed to cope with majority of their work without mulling matters over and over again. In love affairs, they will remain loyal and true to the one they like, even in the face of opposition. They have a taste in arts, music, sculpture, cinema, drama, etc., and know the value of money. They need to lead a temperate life.  
#### Weakness
One should not be so obstinate, nor slow, in action. Also one should not be so selfish nor vindictive by retaining anger for a very long time.
#### Health
Normally, those born under the sign of Taurus have robust health. They appear to have superhuman strength and are best adapted for mechanical and laborious pursuits. They appear to have an overabundance of life rather than a deficiency of it, and are less sensitive to pain. If they fall ill, they suffer for a long time without revealing it, and their recuperative powers are not satisfactory, leading to a slow recovery.
#### Disease
Generally, when Taurus is afflicted, one suffers from tonsils, diphtheria, pyorrhoea, or from the affections of the throat, palate, and neck. They may also suffer from colds and apoplexy, as well as constipation and plethora as they age. As Taurus denotes the throat, it is the part of the body most susceptible to illness. Pimples in the face and eye-sores also give trouble.
#### Finance
Patience and perseverance pay off for those born under the sign of Taurus. They are cautious when spending, especially when in need, and when they have made their fortune, they spend to their satisfaction while keeping a portion in reserve. They do not squander unnecessarily and have the gambling temperament. As Saturn owns the most favourable houses nine and ten, they are able to accumulate and hoard money, and they are able to get money for others, making them suitable for roles such as brokers and underwriters. They are practical and build their fortune on a steady, firm, and reinforced foundation, and measure their success by their savings.
#### Profession of Those Born in Taurus
As those born in Taurus desire to be comfortable and enjoy life to the full, they always go in for the best-paid profession. They have a great liking for trading in luxury goods, as Venus rules this sign. They deal in furs, cosmetics, scents, costly jewels and gems. As it is the second sign of the Zodiac and the second house indicates finance, they may be bankers, or part of a company's management. Stockbrokers, treasurers, cashiers, speculators, gamblers, and race-goers are mostly born in Taurus.  
As Rishaba is said to be the sign of agriculture (Krishi), they may be agriculturists, farmers, gardeners, nursery owners, etc. Venus being the chief governor for music, pleasure, and social success, they will be excellent musicians, actors, film producers, and owners of theatres. Also, bill collectors, employees in the revenue or agricultural department, bookbinders, dressmakers, tailors, chemists, printers, decorators, insurance agents, bus owners, taxi permits, and automobile transport owners are governed by Taurus. Those who deal in flowers, mirrors, glasses, mica, plastic, rubber, rice, cows, cattle, milk, dairy farms, ice cream, parlours, silk, cotton, vegetables, petrol, sugarcane, and sugar are also those born with that planet which indicates their profession of Taurus.  
As Venus is a feminine planet and the sign Taurus is also feminine, one may be employed in a girl's school and ladies' club, law court, income tax department, sales tax department, etc. Dealings in earrings, rings, watches, insulators, hats, shoes, leather, hides and skins, leather pocketbooks, purses, travelling bags, necklaces, garlands, and canes are indicated by Venus.  
When so many modes of earnings are attributed to Taurus, it is left to the ingenuity of the astrologer to judge by considering the other aspects; for instance, one is to consider which planet occupies Taurus; which aspects the sign, or the lord of the sign, Venus, etc. For example, he who supplies boiling milk will have Mars and the sign Taurus in any manner connected, so that Taurus denotes cow, Moon milk, and Mars the fiery planet to boil it. But he who deals with ice cream will have Saturn and Moon connected with Taurus or Venus, its lord, so that Venus denotes cow, Moon milk, and the cold binding planet cools down and brings out ice cream. Venus denotes silk; Venus and Sun indicate silk with lace. Venus and Mars show dealers in rayon; Venus with Mercury indicates cloth merchants. Saturn shows mineral products; Moon and Saturn denote kerosene as Moon is watery; Venus, Moon, and Saturn indicate petrol as Venus shows refinement and is also the chief governor for motor cars, etc.  
Venus is Tejas; beauty and skin. Saturn is for hair growth. Sun for wool; Mars for industry. Venus and Saturn show that one will deal in skins and hides as Saturn is the chief governor for longevity and indicates the dead. So, Saturn and Venus indicate dead skin. Mars indicates industry. If Venus were to be in the twelfth house, then dealings in shoes is to be predicted as the 12th house shows foot. Footwear dealers will have Venus, Saturn, and Mars as the planets indicating profession. If Venus is connected with the second house, it denotes money purse; the third house shows handbag.    
Venus, Saturn, and Mercury show that the native will deal in exports and imports of leather goods. If Sun also has any connection with them, he will deal in woolen goods, carpets, etc. Venus is for scents and for beauty; if Venus is connected with Moon, he will deal in scents and scented oils. If Venus and Moon receive an aspect from Mars, the native may manufacture scented soaps. If Sun is also connected, it indicates medicated soaps. If Venus and Mars alone are connected, they show scented powders. Venus, Sun, and Moon denote Anjan for the eye or eyetex. Venus, Mars, and Moon in the third and twelfth houses indicate the fancy colours in liquid used to polish the nails like Cutex.    
Planets in Taurus indicating vehicle show that he will have a four-legged vehicle; Mars suggests that it will be run by motor; i.e., there is mechanical contrivance; Saturn or Lord of 6 connected with the planets indicating profession and Taurus show that he will be a taxi driver.  
In this manner, one is to analyse and judge. Whatever profession they are, they will prove to be good administrators, maintaining discipline and controlling others. They are hard to budge if they once make a decision; they will go ahead even though there may be opposition. If they have partners in business, it is advisable that the partners do not confront them with fresh ideas suddenly, off and on. They (the partners of Taurus born) should wait, select a time, and plant the seed. Carefully and cautiously, they have to impress on the mind of the Taureans; allow time for them to accept the idea slowly; then they themselves will come out with a little improvement or modification to the original idea, regard it as their own, and finally put the proposal into practice. In service, Taureans are found to be faithful to the end.
#### Domestic Environments
People born in Taurus are good providers and the women are good homemakers. There will be a happy and harmonious life, with comfort, rest, and peace at home. They have a strong affinity for their native land and are attracted to its scenery. Peace, pleasure, prosperity, property, popularity, and position mean a lot to them. Taureans are known to supply sumptuous food and give feasts to others. If they are not served similarly by their guests, they cannot tolerate it. They decorate their house, keep their furniture and other items tidy, and maintain their home in good condition.
#### Marriage and Married Life
People born in Taurus are not generally impulsive and take a long time to make a decision when it comes to selecting a partner in life. Once they decide that a particular individual is ideal, they will stick to it and will not rest until they are successful. Since the sign is an earthy one, those born in the other two earthy signs or in the three watery signs will prove to be good partners, contributing to peace and maintaining harmony, leading to a happy life. There may be romances for Taurus-borns; if they fall in love with someone, they are faithful to them to the last. Their emotions are deep and they do not like to quarrel, nor do they enjoy confusion. The men born in Taurus will have loving wives and the ladies born in this sign will have devoted husbands. Love is real to them and they will always fulfill their social and financial obligations. They will always be affectionate, warm, and ever-loving, responding to kind treatment and flattered by luxury. Divorce is rare and they will endure and suffer even untold miseries and never desert their partner. They will have a feeling that their partner must be sheltered, looked after, attended to, cared for, and protected under any circumstances.  
Taurus husbands adore their wives and do not mind taking all pains to supply them with whatever they want. They may have partners born in a higher rank and may not be related, as the lord of the seventh house is also the lord of the twelfth house. They are reliable, generous, and faithful and will never neglect their home. They want their wives to dress nicely and look attractive and never find their domestic life tiresome. They will never regret marriage and look back to their school days when they were bachelors and were free to do as they pleased.  
Taurus wives will behave both like a mother and a wife. They will appear to be reserved and calm and may doubt their husband's love and affection, but make no secret of their love. They will also be equally anxious to lead a happy, harmonious wedded life. They seem to care more for their homes than they do for themselves between husband and wife. They are more satisfactory and dutiful parents than they are as partners in life. The softer side of their nature endows them with a gentleness, a peacefulness, and a serenity which makes them the most desirable companions in any relationship of life. Their feelings are not easily hurt and do not find hasty or ill-timed expression.  
#### Children
Parents born in Taurus will appear to be strict with their children and may even appear to be tyrannical. However, their intentions are good and their children will, in the long run, realize it and be much benefited. Therefore, they are capable and conscientious parents who try to lead a noble family life. The children will always treat the parents with respect and bring them great pleasure and satisfaction. They will be well-built and intelligent.
#### Handwriting
As Taurus-borns have a great liking for beauty and art, due to Venus, their handwriting will be beautifully curved, small, and smooth. Being economical, they do not leave much space in between words or in between lines. They do not use offensive words and are always mild and gentle. Invariably, they put a full-stop after their signature and underline their signature with artistic hooks at both ends.
#### Day
Generally, Friday is their lucky day. Grand success can be expected on Wednesdays; Saturdays delay the results, but do not deny nor disappoint. Ultimately, on Saturdays, Taurus-borns will be crowned with success. Tuesdays show extravagant expenses. Thursdays denote gain through a partner. Mondays indicate a short journey and pleasant correspondence. Sundays show rest at home.

#### Character to be Corrected
The general indications of Taurus are dealt with in detail and are applicable only when the Taurus sign is not afflicted by any planet. However, if the birth-sign Taurus receives adverse aspects, the person will experience undesirable effects and results. To counteract this, it is necessary to cultivate certain virtues and try to avoid the evil effect.  
For instance, if Mars and Mercury afflict the ascendant Taurus, or Mars afflicts Mercury in Taurus or Mercury forms an evil aspect with Mars in Taurus, this makes one a criminal. Similarly, Saturn and Mercury give them the courage to commit forgery and cheat the bank. Saturn alone afflicting the ascendant makes the native lazy and lethargic, as they do not realise that life moves ever forward and they generally do not move along with it. As a result, they are soon out of step and out of tune.  
People born in Taurus, having these adverse aspects, must correct themselves in order to enjoy the real fruits of life in this world. The results mentioned above may be modified by the planets in each sign.  

### Gemini - Mithunam
Gemini is the third sign of the Zodiac, extending from the 60th degree from the Vernal Equinox (or Mesha 0 degree) to 90 degrees, and is thirty degrees in Longitude. Mrigasirisha third and fourth padas, Thiruvadhirai or Arudhra and Punarpushyam first, second and third padas are contained in this sign. Gemini is the first of the airy triplicity and also of the mutable signs. It is masculine and positive, and classified as a barren sign.  
Gemini is ruled by Mercury, an effeminate but intellectual planet. No planet gets either exaltation or debilitation in this sign, but Jupiter is said to be in its detriment in this sign as it is the house which opposes Sagittarius owned by Jupiter. To Saturn and Venus this sign is said to be friendly, and to the other planets it is considered to be the enemy's quarters.  
#### Physical Features
Gemini gives a tall, upright, straight body; the hands will be long. The legs will be thin and the veins will be visible. Complexion will be moderate, fair or dark, depending on the planet which rises then in Gemini at the time of birth. The eyes will be hazel and the look quick, sharp and active. Nose will be long.
#### Characteristics
Being an airy sign, persons born in this sign live mostly in the mind. They will be carefree and joyous and somewhat reluctant. Their mind will be positive and strong. They are versatile, restless and inclined to have changes often. As Mercury is the lord of the sign, one will be inclined to be reading, writing and corresponding often. They can understand people and adopt themselves readily to circumstances. They can offer advice, persuade and argue with others. They can explain the merits and demerits of a case, but they cannot command or manage successfully. Being a common sign and the third sign of the Zodiac, these persons will have a liking to travel frequently. These may be mainly short journeys by land. They are always active with a facile mind. They will always be considering the advantages and disadvantages of each case and hence decision will not be taken quickly.  
Gemini is termed as twins. Mercury, the lord of the sign is depicted as a boy, among all Gods, not full-grown. In the ancient symbolic pictures, the twins were brother and sister. Mercury is also said to be "The Winged Messenger of God". Mercury has both wings on its helmet and also sandals. That is why, Geminians are very quick. It is said that people with some important and big things to express, generally elect the time of Gemini as they have the faith that this sign will give sharp intelligence, adaptability and ultimately grand success.  
Being a dual sign, it gives the native the ability to follow more than one occupation at a time and also to adopt oneself to new surroundings. One should avoid going to extremes. Geminians may be impulsively generous at times and also parsimonious with others. They have to avoid superficiality. Then they will have insight and capacity more than enough to do any work intelligently. They will have dual experiences in their life. These people can be relied upon in any emergency as they can respond to the necessities and requirements of the moment. They have a few faults as waywardness, fickleness and leaving their work unfinished. They will take up some work and while they are doing it, they will go on to another which also they are apt to leave unfinished. Therefore, they can be at their best when they cooperate with others and undertake to do any job. The dual sign makes them both generous and niggardly. They will gather courage, present a courageous front and assertive attitude even though they are highly timid and nervous. It is very difficult for others to understand them and their peculiarities. They are rather impulsive. It is the impulse that will decide which line of action one will take. They can never stand any anxiety or worry. They love diversity; like the air to which they belong; they have to be moving from place to place or from one thought to the other. They refuse to be bound by rules and habits. They are pleased only when they act unexpectedly, rather than in accordance with convention.  
If Moon can be compared to a mirror, Mercury may be compared to a lens. Those who are governed by Moon will simply repeat what they have crammed. But Mercurians are persons revealing intellectual qualities and show all the signs of mental dexterity and supreme intelligence. They will understand, analyse, have a quick grasp with much retentive power and reproductive ability. Then mind will be logical and clear and they have quick mental action. They are always alert for any new idea and fresh interest. They are quick-witted and clever. The house, Gemini, is called the house of oscillation and vacillation. So these persons are changeable. They are apt to diffuse their energies and spread their action on diverse subjects.  
Being an airy sign ruled by Mercury (Budha), the native will be having much of curiosity and will seek after facts. He will go deep into all matters as though he is doing research. He will prove to be a good detective, a brilliant journalist, and an excellent schemer. They have the talent for language and Gemini being an intellectual sign, they have no difficulty in remembering things. They cannot concentrate on one subject. It is said that the Geminans have too many irons in the fire. Their range of thought is very wide. If retrograde Mercury were also to rise at the time of birth, the native will prefer to sidestep the truth and enjoy a good joke. They cannot believe what they have not seen or experienced. Their viewpoint will always be reasonable. They can understand the other's outlook and adapt themselves to it. They are inclined to indulge in practical wit and ask many questions. They have an academic and teachable nature with a democratic attitude. They have a humane and genial personality with a fondness for good company. They can never remain in ignorance because they are not afraid of asking questions till they get a clear idea and understand it.  
#### Weakness
No one can do things more easily than the Geminians. None can do them more gracefully; and none can compete with them more successfully. But the weakness in them is they should have the deliberate determination to do their work and stick to it till it is completed. They lack concentration and quick decision. They should not give themselves up to petty strife. The defect in them is that they are always hasty and anxious to know the results then and there. Once they have planted the seeds, they do not give chance for them to nature. They will water and nurture them but they will often be digging them up to see how far they have progressed. The other peculiarity with them is that they want only short cuts. They are able to carry out work quickly adopting improved methods. Events will move faster in their life then in those of other persons.
#### What is wanted
They should take rest, take plenty of exercise, breathe plenty of fresh air, eat conservatively and cultivate physical and mental poise. They should have a definite aim in life and should stick to it. They should have a balanced outlook and should not be carried away by their own enthusiasm. They should have a sense of responsibility and should not be too much swayed by their emotions.
#### Health and Disease
Geminians are as active as their minds. They often spoil their health by unnecessary and unavoidable worry and anxiety. Their thin build and nervousness give the impression to others that their health is delicate like a barometer. If they avoid mental strain, their health will be normally good. They should not overtax themselves by undertaking a large variety of work. If they relax and get plenty of sleep, they can maintain good health.  
As Gemini rules over the lungs, all pulmonary affections are indicated by this sign, such as colds, runny noses, influenza, bronchitis, and tuberculosis. It also indicates shoulders and arms, and any defects in these parts are indicated by malefics in Gemini. As the sixth house from Gemini is Scorpio, people born in Gemini generally suffer from the diseases indicated by Scorpio, such as strangury, piles, fistula, affections of the bladder and excretory system, fever, and poisoning of the system. Therefore, if Gemini is afflicted, they will have defects in the pulmonary system, or they will have the diseases mentioned for Scorpio, as it is the house of diseases for Gemini-borns.  
#### Finance and Fortune
Geminians will experience both privation and plenty during their lifetime. There will be a lot of changes and they will enjoy life with good fortune or suffer continuous misfortune depending on the nature of their planets. There will be family disputes and they will not agree with their father. They may bring about their own downfall due to their secret connections to love affairs (if the planets Mars, Saturn, and Venus ruling the 6th, 8th, and 12th houses also contribute) and attachments, which will bring loss and difficulties. Some may have progeny through such connections, which will be a perennial source of trouble and headache.
#### Profession
Geminians are alert, active, and industrious, and they wish to have interesting and varied jobs. Their inquisitiveness, liking for talk, and sense of humour make them good speakers and ultimately bring them to the front of the public. They are capable brokers, intelligent agents, successful merchants, satisfactory secretaries, and efficient advocates. They can read the minds of their customers and know what they like and what they discard. Fully aware of their likes and dislikes, they can sell articles at a good profit, convincing and pleasing the clients. Those who have Mercury retrograde will prove to be good critics and, with the aid of Jupiter's beneficial aspect, will be one of the leaders in journalism. If Mars also lends its assistance, they will have the fortune to own a press, as planet Mars stands for machinery, Mercury for paper and news, and Jupiter for publicity and propaganda. As it is an airy sign and Mercury indicates art and publicity, Mars and Gemini will produce radio-mechanics, assistants in the Defense Department, typists, compositors, or mechanics in aeronautics. Mercury stands for mathematics, and the greatest mathematicians are born in Gemini with very strong Mercury. Gemini, being the house of oscillation and the third house of the zodiac, suggests that the natives will love travel and movement from one place to the other and also a liking for changes in their profession. They will not have the inclination or pleasure to enjoy the sceneries but an inexplicable urge to be on the move. So they will be very good camp-clerks, traveling agents, traveling ticket-examiners, engine-drivers in the railway, and guards. The difference between the driver and the guard is that for the driver, Mars will be strong and aspecting the house for profession (10th house) or the lord of the 10th house or in any manner connected with lord of 2 (finance), or lord of 6 (service), or lord of 10 (profession). But for the post of the guard, Jupiter will be aspecting the planet in Gemini as Jupiter is the protector. Generally, Geminians are Jack of all trades. Being a dual sign, they will try to enhance their income by doing some side-business. They will be always on the lookout for new methods of earning which will bring them more money than what they get in any substantive post. A teacher may have tuition, a permanent servant in an office may take up any agency and increase his income, a typist in an office will take job works beyond office hours, or the clever Geminian may attend to other work during office hours, take up his regular work late in the evening, and claim overtime. Saturn's evil aspect and also Mars' malefic aspect will tempt one and offer him courage to misappropriate. Hence, they should never be allowed to handle cash. They should not accept the post of a booking clerk, cashier, or bill collector. As Gemini people will be receiving vast influence, good backing, and support, they can take up any post, stick to it without vacillation and worry, and slowly and surely rise in affluence and worry. They are advised, however, to be economical and not stingy and to meet all expenses with cheer. Money will not pour in for them, but their earnings are normally, in most of the cases, regular.
#### Domestic Environments
Gemini people will always be busy due to the frequent visits of business partners, customers, relatives, and friends. They delight in entertaining them. Though they may appear to be a little extravagant, they will manage their family well. They have a great liking for decorating their home and keeping it in modern style. They will not tolerate the nuisance of the owner of the house in which they are put up if the owner happens to be mean-minded and they will not mind changing their residence even frequently until they get a satisfactory one. As Gemini people cannot keep idle without ever thinking of how to improve the house, they will be doing something or other to give comforts to all the members in the family. They are ever fair.
#### Romance, Marriage, and Married Life
Geminians are capable of making friendships very quickly. So also they will find fault with them equally quickly. That is why they often fail to find a friend to their satisfaction even though they long for it. They do not wish to get themselves tied to one, but prefer variety in life, for Gemini is a dual sign, and the natives will feel that variety is the spice of life. The more the romances, the happier they will be.   
Such people cannot be understood easily. They will baffle many of their associates as they break off association with them if it does not interest them. Their affection is controlled by the mind more than by the emotions. They look on love from the intellectual angle and are often calculating or cynical.  
Marriage is full of interest and exciting for them. They are lucky if they get partners who are steady and accommodating. Marriage will be successful and delightful if the partner is equally intelligent. Both enjoy life by frequent short trips. The partner should be clever enough to appreciate the native's alert and intuitive mind. Gemini males need such wives who will always say 'Yes' whenever husbands wish to have a change of surroundings and environments. The partners should not take their flirtations seriously. The natives are so clever that they will end any romance if they feel that it is a source of expense and loss. These people will leave their homes if they find that they are having overbearing wives. They are unable to put up with constant pressure from the partners. Gemini brides are generally intelligent. Their strongest appeal is mental companionship, and they do not wish to be mere housekeepers. They will not give up their outside activities even though they get married, especially if they are already in service or well equipped for any service. They do not feel happy if their husbands were to resent. These girls have to be more tactful if they wish for happy, harmonious lives. As time passes on, they themselves will realize that they can have either of the two and will not mind giving up one and sticking to the other. For instance, if they want to serve and be a career woman, they will neglect the husband. But if they desire to lead a respectable home-life, they will give up their jobs and take to domestic life with utmost sincerity and devotion. They will be highly refined and will keep their homes tidy and arrange everything in apple-pie-order.  
Gemini people will have good understanding with partners born in the other airy signs Libra and Aquarius; because these two airy signs will form trine aspect with Gemini. The other two signs favorable are sextile to Gemini, i.e., Aries and Leo. Hence partners born in Thulam, Kumbum, Mesha, and Simha will match satisfactorily, their artistic tastes and mental attributes being similar. Natives born in Libra and Aquarius will have such an outlook on things which will please the husband or wife. Leonians (those born in Simha) should give up possessiveness and egotism. Arians lack the cultural standard otherwise they are happy. Geminians will have to give up the curious trait which will hurt the partner; that is, their tendency to make use of the same words and expressions of love to two and even more attachments. When one comes to know of this, the domestic life comes to an end in fireworks.  
#### Children
The Geminians are fond of their children because they are loved by them. They cannot be very paternal or maternal in their attitude towards their children. They may even feel that their children are a nuisance. So their bark will be worse than their bite. Their children need careful handling by the parents who have to understand them properly. Their minds will be very plastic and yielding and hence they can be molded in the right direction by the parents. They will have much of intuition. If the parents are not true or try to force anything on their children, the latter will not take it all right.
#### Handwriting
Gemini-borns will write a little above the line. The upper part of the letters will be well developed. The lines will be short, sharp, and inclined upwards. Their writing will be thin and loopless. They will not underline their signature and try to finish their letters quickly or if they underline, they will draw two lines one below the other.
#### Lucky day
Wednesday is ruled by Mercury who owns Gemini. Thursdays will prove to be lucky ones. Saturdays indicate much of difficulties, obstacles, and loss. Sundays offer short journeys and only on those days they clear off the arrears in their correspondence. Mondays will show an increase in their income. Fridays denote pleasurable pursuits and pleasant functions or expenses. On Tuesdays there may be a difference of opinion and even disputes, but on Tuesdays only, there will be victory over enemies. The most lucky day will be Thursday, and next to it only will be Wednesday.
#### Lucky color
Green and Yellow. Avoid Blue and Red.
#### Lucky number
Five and Three, Fourteen, Twelve, etc.
#### Lucky stone
Emerald and Yellow sapphire.

#### Character to be corrected
Lack of concentration gives only a shallow understanding. They are occasionally heartless and behave like a cynic. Don't waver. Don't examine your own thoughts too much as you will become self-centered and discontented. Don't place yourself under any strain as it may lead one to be deceitful and dishonest. Don't try to do many things at the same time. Do one at a time. Do not pay heed to gossip as you will be easily influenced.

### Cancer: The Fourth Sign of the Zodiac
Cancer is the fourth sign of the Zodiac, located 30° from the 90th degree from the Vernal Equinox (or Aries Mesha 0 degrees) to the 120th degree. Punarvasu (Punarpushyam) 4th quarter (pada), Pushya (Poosam) and Aslesha (Ayilyam) are contained in the sign Cancer. Cancer is the first sign of the watery triplicity, the other two being Vrischika and Meena. Its quality is cardinal, movable, or chars. It is a feminine and fruitful sign, and is also a mute sign. If, for instance, a malefic like Ketu is posited in Cancer in the second house, it indicates a defect in speech; the native may be even dumb. Cancer is one of the five Prishtodaya rasis (Mesha, Rishaba, Dhanus, and Makara are the other four signs rising with their back). Cancer is a nocturnal sign (Gemini) and all Prishtodaya signs are termed nocturnal signs. It is a tropical sign, and a sign of long ascension. When the Sun is in Cancer, it will be in the northern hemisphere, and so Cancer is also termed a northern sign.  
This sign is symbolized by a crab. This does not mean that the crabs are fishy, nor that people born in Cancer are. Rather, the type of people born between these dates are called the Teacher or the Prophet, because they can teach or preach or recite or act or speak in public and carry the gathering with them. Cancer is governed by the Moon, and Jupiter is exalted here, its highest point of exaltation being 5 degrees. Mars is debilitated in this sign and is said to be completely debilitated (Paramaneecha) in the 28th degree. To the Sun, Cancer is a friend's sign; to Mercury, Venus, and Saturn, it is an enemy's quarter.  
#### Physical Features
Clumsy body, slender limbs, and powerful claws are the peculiarities of the crab. People born in Cancer generally have a large upper body. As age advances, they acquire, by over-eating, a prominent abdomen. Their face is wide between the ears, and the mouth is large with nice teeth of chalky colour. The hair is usually brown and the complexion pale. As the limbs are extremely slender when compared to the large upper body, the whole body appears top heavy and one will walk with a rolling gait. Generally, dwarfs are born in this sign.
#### Characteristics
The ruling planet of Cancer is the Luna or the Moon, Juliet says, "Oh, swear not by the Moon, the inconstant Moon, the inconstant Moon!". But Professor Masefield says, "The Moon, the inconstant, keeps her will". Cancer-born natives are remarkable for a changeful life. They have many ups and downs. Moon gives them fertile imagination, delighting in strange scenes and adventures. They can adapt to other's nature and quickly absorb other's ideas. They are often emotional and over-sensitive and also sympathetic. They are somewhat sentimental and talkative. Due to extreme sensitiveness, there will be a high degree of nervous irritability. They ably move the public to gain some position of wealth or honours. Just as one can see the Moon either waxing or waning, either as Full Moon or as New Moon, so also one can find the Cancer-borns timid on some occasions and very courageous under other circumstances.   
Generally, they are timid to face physical danger, but are brave in mental or moral attitude. Their temper is also changeable. Anger comes and goes in quick alternation.  
Cancer, being the fourth sign of the zodiac and the fourth house, indicates one's domestic environments. Cancer-borns are fond of home, family, and its comforts. They have tenacious memory, especially for family or historic events. Fear of ridicule or criticism makes them discreet, diplomatic, and conventional. They appreciate approbation and are easily encouraged by kindness. The ladies, born in this sign, are discreet and independent in many things.   
They are very laborious, though somewhat exacting.   
Their anger is short-lived and they hold no spite against anybody. As the fourth house shows estates, evil planets herein show that there will be difficulty in acquiring wealth. It is also likely that inheritance is lost through relatives or through children or speculation or by love attachments and pleasurable pursuits. Such experience will be only in the first part of the life of the Cancer-borns. In the latter part of their life, they will have grand success and prosperity. Generally, all Cancer-borns inherit money, property, kingdom, etc., but it comes to them only with great tardiness, or in spite of various hindrances, impediments, and obstacles. In advanced years, their children are often the source of protection.  
Cancer is said to be the sign of sensitive people and mediums. The higher vibrations of Cancer give the endowment of clairvoyance and a keen feeling for art. So the Cancer-borns have the psychic and mediumistic faculty. Many magicians, mimics, and actors are born in Cancer.  
Most of the Cancer-borns are sensitive, retiring, and unassuming. If they are ignored, overlooked, or neglected, they become moody and also peevish. Like the elephant, they will never forget.  
One will be lucky to have a partner born in Cancer who will be romantic and imaginative. The Cancer-borns recapture the golden moments of the past and keep the partner cheerful and enthusiastic.  
Cancer being a watery sign, the native can be easily influenced and will adjust to circumstances as water takes the shapes of the vessel in which it is kept.  
Water is not compressible. So also Cancer-borns, when coerced become very stubborn and determined; they will not yield.  
Cancer, being a movable and a watery sign, as water runs in a river, many Cancer-borns lead a wandering and restless life, thrown this way and that way, by emotions and imagination, by which they are completely ruled. They have rarely the necessary showmanship and push to come to the fore. Anyhow, it is from the states and position of the Moon at birth that the opportunities and chances can be reliably assessed.  
In love affairs, once their love is given or their affections centered they are strong and true. They will never give up unless the partner does something very drastic. Generally, they pour out boundless affection. That is why the relatives and friends enjoy real happiness in being underneath the Cancerian's roof.  
The Cancer-borns are famous for true hospitality.  
They tend to miss many an opportunity, being in the habit of pondering over a thing over and over again and put off the requisite action promptly at the proper time. When they are ready to move, they will find that the chance has slipped away. They will be undecided as to whether to purchase a lottery ticket, or not, and pass on any weeks in this way and when, finally; they decide to buy, they will find that the lottery had already been drawn. One will delay buying an umbrella or a raincoat but when he buys one, the rainy season would have come to an end. This should not be cultivated.  
Cancer-born natives have the deep feelings of loyalty and responsibility, if they decide upon a plan, they stick to it with dogged determination; success in their efforts is enjoyed ultimately. They are much more interested in getting small sums of money from a variety of sources than a big and sizable amount from one source. Anyone, getting a considerable lump amount in any single business, is not likely to be born in Cancer.  
Cancer-born natives realize the fullest significance of money and they are a little too personal.  
He may conquer the trials in his life, yet he does not forget them easily. They are ever brought to memory. A father who, from a humble beginning, rose up to a high position later, will, even though he is affluent, will constantly keep before his children the poverty in which he once lived.  
Cancer-born natives are ultimately fortunate.   
They will appear open and frank at sight, but, in reality, they are not so, as they hide much from others. They are impressionable and magnetic.  
#### Characteristics to be corrected
He has to be patient. People born in Cancer, with Saturn rising in the Ascendant, alone will be patient. Mars rising in Cancer makes one short-tempered also. Hence, patience and endurance are to be cultivated. Don't be very sensitive and extremely selfish. Changeability and indolence are the other weaknesses.
#### Health
Being the fourth sign of the Zodiac and one ruled by Moon, the health of the Cancer-borns will be fragile in youth, but as age advances, they will pick up health. Cancer rules the chest and stomach. As Moon owns this sign and it indicates one's worry etc., the chief cause of their physical troubles will be only worry.   
They have to take care of both the pulmonary and digestive systems. If they control their mind, they can control their body with the help of a reasonable diet, proper physical care, etc. They suffer much but they can also endure much. They should not let their love of liquids lead to over-indulgence in the alcoholic kind.   
They have to guard against asthma, gastric disturbances, and weak digestion. They should take care of the throat. Simple living is the best preventive.  
They should satisfy thirst with water and not with alcohol. A few suffer from rheumatism and sciatica.  
There are also indications of danger by falls and hurts from animals while traveling or residing in foreign countries. 
#### Disease
Affections of both the lungs, flu, cough, asthma, bronchitis, pleurisy, tuberculosis, affections of the oesophagus, stomach, dyspepsia, flatulence, dropsy, ben-ben, nervous debility, fear complex, hysteria, jaundice, obstruction of the bile, gall stones, worms, and boils on the chest just below the collar bone.
#### Finance and Profession
People born under the sign of Cancer are best suited to a commercial career, especially to the trade of a caterer. Many manage their own restaurants, coffee and tea stalls. Some run general stores, grocers, fruit stalls, etc. Those who enter into service are employed in hospitals as male and female nurses, matrons, managers, and secretaries in business, hire purchase regulators, undertakers, furnishers, etc. As Cancer-borns are historians and are interested in things of the past, they deal in antiquities; they collect curios. They get employed in the history section or archaeological department, or at least they will deal in second-hand articles.  
Cancer being a watery sign, Cancer-borns are dealers in things derived from water: couches, pearls, fish, etc. They also work as great sailors, sea captains, explorers, and in the navy and submarine. Some may serve in the shipping department, and take active interest in imports and exports, transport or travel, and in concerns dealing in milk products.  
As Jupiter is exalted in this sign, many born in this sign become successful preachers, inspiring teachers, eloquent orators, platform speakers, state ministers, and popular advisers. Mars, being debilitated here, indicates the krisans, agriculturists, and those working in gardens. Saturn in detriment shows that some will live by digging wells, excavating tanks, or diving in the sea.  
Cancer being the fourth sign of the Zodiac, the natives will be interested in developing Vedic and sacred texts. Cancer-borns are careful where money is concerned. Being themselves very honest, they cannot tolerate dishonesty in others. Their tastes are modest and hence they do not defray expenses on extravagant display. They value money for what it is worth and are very prudent. They accumulate wealth by dint of their own hard efforts.  
#### Domestic Environments
Cancer-born natives are devoted to their family and love their home wherever they live. The home and garden always keep them engaged, and they derive pleasure from being alone. They collect old things and store them in shelves and kitchen. Though they make constant journeys, they are only truly at home when they are in their own home. They do not mind taking trouble to make their life comfortable and will invite friends and attend to them to their fullest satisfaction.  
#### Friends and Benefactors
As Cancer-born natives are hypersensitive and unassuming, they have a great desire to acquire friendship but they do not have many long-standing and intimate friends. The Cancer-borns become moody and peevish whenever they feel that some friends neglect them or overlook them. But they will never forget the good done to them by friends and remain grateful to the core. They will recollect the old days and ponder over the benefits bestowed by friends.  
#### Romance
For Cancer-born natives, life is monotonous without romance. They will sacrifice their comforts, etc., and be very loyal and affectionate. But they cannot impress upon the mind of the partner that they are sincere, honest, and very true. The other is prone to feel that the Cancer-borns are fickle-minded and changeable, while, in fact, they are remarkably stubborn and determined.    
#### Marriage
Cancer-born natives enjoy their family life to the full and the home and family are of great consequence to them. Marriage, therefore, offers them an opportunity to have a well-settled life. Husbands born in Cancer are mostly affectionate, adjusting, and accommodating, even though, at times, they may be exacting and fussy. A Cancer-born native will generally contract marriage with a girl who will pave the way for domestic comfort and further prosperity. They will manage to keep the wife cheerful and buoyant, pleasing her in all ways. They are devoted to their wives, and occasionally, they will interfere in household routine and thereby spoil their good intentions. Their trait is, and this requires correction, that they are often dissatisfied and will be indulging in criticism of something or other.  
Girls born in Cancer are genuine in their love and sincere in their devotion to husbands. Occasionally they tend to be moody. They feel satisfied with anything offered by their husbands and prove good mothers to their children. They are adaptable and affectionate, dutiful and devoted, patient and pleasing, and sincere and sympathetic. They will spare no pains to attend to the needs of their husbands and offer them spiritual strength.  
#### Children
Cancer-born natives take efforts to give good education to their children and they are excellent parents in the matter of providing all facilities and comforts to them. They will go to the limit of sacrificing even their own needs, if necessary, to avoid denial of their children's desires. They are never disheartened by the large size of their family. Their children also remain grateful, obedient, dutiful, and faithful; they have great energy, courage, and independence. They are very frank; they stand up for their rights and never submit to imposition. They are full of worries, brooding over things that may happen, but they will never flinch in the hour of danger. They will perform deeds of heroism with a disregard of self which may amount to foolhardiness. Their mind will be cool, calm, collected, and sharp.
#### Handwriting
Moon, the lord of the sign, being variable in nature, the handwriting also will be variable; the formation of letters will be in different ways and shapes. Their letters will become large as they go on writing. When they are in a good mood, they draw wavy lines beneath their signatures.
#### Lucky Day
Tuesday is the day of success. Fridays give pleasure and profit. Wednesday is good for journey, investment, and expenses. Thursdays are good for contacting and arranging overdraft accounts. To join a college for higher studies, or to go overseas or to contact foreigners, Thursdays will prove auspicious. Avoid Saturdays as disharmony, difference of opinion, depression, dispute, delay, and denial will be the result generally. Mondays will give changeable temperament and success in efforts. Sundays are pleasant to have the company of close relatives and also to gain money. Also one should be lucky on the days when Moon transits in Mrigasirisha, Chitra, and Dhanishta (Avittam) star days. Poosam (Pushyam), Aslesha (Ayilyam), Anuradha (Anusham), Jyeshta (Kettai), Uthrabhadrapada (Uttirattathi), and Revati star days are to be avoided.
#### Lucky Colour
White, cream, red, and yellow are lucky colours. Blue and green colours should be avoided.
#### Luck Number
2, 7, and 9 are fortunate. 1, 3, 4, and 6 are good. 5 and 8 are to be avoided.
#### Lucky Gems
Diamond, pearls, ruby, and yellow sapphire. Avoid blue sapphire and emerald. Blue colour shows opposition and emerald will not allow one to save.
#### Places
Canals, rivers, lakes, seas, wells, springs, brooks, sinks, streams, ditches, marshes, trenches, wash-houses, cellars, pumps, fisheries, dairy farms, car stands, cart stands, common sewers, wharfs, and fields near the sea.
#### Products
Milk and milky products, silver, tea, petrol, shipping, commerce, business, all liquids, fruits, coffee (liquid), rubber, greens, cabbage, and mushroom.
#### Countries Indicated
Holland, Scotland, New Zealand, North and West Africa, Mauritius, Anatolia near Constantinople, Paraguay, and Sweden.
#### Towns and Cities
St. Andrews, Deptford, Manchester, Rochdale, York, New York, Algiers, Amsterdam, Berne, Cadiz, Constantinople, Genoa, Lubeck, Magdeburg, Milan, Tunis, and Venice.
#### Animate and Inanimate Objects
Paspalum, plantains, Dhurva grass, fruits, bulbs, fragrant leaves, coconuts, barley, wheat, rice, sugarcane, forests, ministers, kings, fishermen, honest persons, those who sacrifice their comforts, counterfeits, bulbs, roots, fruits, worms, reptiles, poison, robbers, husk-gram, physicians, etc.
#### Characteristics to be Corrected
They have to overcome their timidity by their efforts with practical results. They should avoid inferiority complex. They should try to have something stable upon which they can pin their hopes. They should not be overanxious about the future. They should not be passive and lazy and should not pay attention to sentimentalities and vanity. They should not control emotions and develop the spiritual side. They should not be vindictive. And success will be in store for them.

### Leo or Simha
Leo is the central sign of the fiery triplicity, with Aries being the first fiery sign and Sagittarius being the third and last one. It is a hot, dry, masculine, positive, bestial, and barren sign, and is also a fixed sign and of ascension. Leo is ruled by the Sun, and only the Sun and Moon, the two luminaries, govern one sign each, Leo and Cancer respectively. Other planets, excluding Uranus and Neptune, own two houses each. In astrology, the luminaries, Sun and Moon, are considered to be "planets". Moon, Mars, and Jupiter are said to be in friend's quarters when they are in Leo, while Saturn, Venus, and Mercury are considered to be in enemy's camp if they transit in Leo. Uranus gets weakened in Leo, while Neptune gains strength. No planet gets exalted or debilitated in Leo.
#### Physical Features
People born in Leo will typically have well-developed bones, broad shoulders, and a tall, well-built, and muscular physique. They will never be plump or ugly, and will have a majestic, imposing, commanding, and dignified stature. The complexion of a Leo will vary depending on the exact position of the ascendant and the planets occupying or aspecting the ascendant.  
The personality of a person born in Leo will be as mentioned above if the ruler of the sign, the Sun, occupies it. However, this external expression can be modified due to the influence of the planets in the ascendant, the occupation of any sign by the ruler of the ascendant, and the various aspects from the other planets both the cusp of the ascendant and its lord. This means that even among twins born on the same day and in the same Lagna, there will be some differences due to this modification; otherwise, there would only be twelve patterns and it would be difficult to identify each individual.  
#### Characteristics
Sun owns Leo-Sim ha, Masefield says "The Sun still scatters out his store, It is true and the people born in this sign are noble, large-hearted, magnanimous and generous. Sun is necessary for the life and the growth of both the vegetables and animal kingdom. But, whenever Sun becomes furious, it destroys them. Darkness envelopes in the absence of Sun; when once Sun rises, none knows where the darkness has gone.   
Therefore the people born in this sign are helpful to mankind and other creations of God. Sun removes their darkness, ignorance and evil thoughts. It is said that Sun represents the Government. Those who have good aspect of Jupiter to Sun, invariably are assisted by, protected by and saved by the Government. Saturn forming evil aspect to Sun shows that such persons will be hated by, chased by and punished by the Government. So, either to lead a healthy and happy life or to face difficulties and lead a miserable life depends on the aspect to Sun and to the Cusp of the ascendant Leo. Accordingly, the characteristic of the person will get modified.  
Sun is the King of all the planets. It is masculine.  
So, the Leonians have dignity. They will have great faith in all friends and relatives and confide everything with them. They are capable of inspiring affection and admiration and have their purpose served by the willing co-operation of their colleagues and subordinates.  
Generally Leonians become the head of a show, registrar, ruler, chairman, host, hostess, managing director, administrator and chief of any organization and continue for a long period. At the same time these persons never hesitate to issue an order or ordinance to protect the interest of the mass. They do not talk much—the main characteristic is the habit of silence.   
They leave all the talking to others. They will hear very patiently all the complaints even from the menials and also pay heed to every rumor. But the judgment will be wise. They have the large-minded tolerance. They are endlessly energetic in serving their people. They will always forgive and forget the mistakes, sins, errors and deficiencies of others. They desire to be honored. But there is no false prestige in them. They mingle with people holding high offices and also menials. Since they trust everybody, it is not likely that they are cheated and disappointed as they do not discriminate. They live in a world of their own creation and nothing appears to be great for their ideality.  
Sun is worshipped during its transit from one sign to the other, especially during the time when it passes the Vernal equinox, as Vishu, or New Year's Day etc., when it enters Cancer as Dakshinayana; when it enters Libra in Thula month and when it passes on Capricorn as Makara Sankranthi. Just as Sun needs the feasts and sacrifices celebrated in its honor, so also the people born Leo are pleased by the praise of others.    
Anything can be had through a Leonian, if one honors him and speaks high of him in his presence.  
Generally, Mercurians are the favorites of the Leonians as they will not mind adopting those measures which will please them, and also mention that the Leonians have organizing powers and they are constructive, inventive, magnanimous and ingenious. They will take advantage of Leonians who are susceptible to flattery which may tend to become an exaggerated ego. Therefore don't fall a victim to flattery but correct yourself by remembering the old adage that, "He who has the greatest authority seldom shows it".  
As Leo is a fiery and fixed sign, it denotes authority and ambition, brilliance and boasting, clever action and commanding, dignity and domineering energy and enthusiasm, faith and fame, glory and grace, hopes and honour, intellect and inspiration, joy and jubilation, kindness and kingliness, loyalty and leadership, magnanimity and majesty, pomp and pride, respect and royalty, stately and scrupulous, vitality and vigour, and warmth and zeal.  
Leo being the fifth sign of the Zodiac, there will be an inordinate zeal and enthusiasm for sports and speculation. One will be interested in the pleasurable pursuits. In him, the higher emotions are the main centre of activity. He may take interest in music, opera, games, etc.  
Leo being a fixed sign, the person may be obstinate or indifferent as there will be the firmness and fixity of purpose. He is at his best only when there are handicaps and obstacles. He has considerable will power to win his way to his entire satisfaction. Having full faith and hope, he can accomplish and achieve his aims by persistent determination.  
Leonians are frank, open and just. Their outbursts do not last long, just like the extreme heat of the Sun. Leonians are noble and lofty in character. They scorn the mean, sordid and puny actions. They will never stoop to do a low act even when they get irritated or when there is the strong urge or self-interest. They do not hesitate to serve those whom they love even if they have to forego their comforts and everything for their loyal and true friends. They never do anything halfheartedly.  
As by nature they are authoritative and commanding, they want to be at the head of things, boss over others and be a leader. They dislike subordination. They will help everybody voluntarily. They will also donate or do charity whenever it appeals to them. But they resent those people who persistently ask for something. They do not, by nature, like those who make any demand upon the Leonians.  
Saturn forming good aspect with Sun or the ascendant Leo avoids giving way to fits of temper and over-exertion, so that there is no ill-effect on the heart. They will try and rise above any depression or sorrow they may have. It will protect one from committing mistakes and one will not be dictatorial and overbearing. They will guard against self-deception, false pride, hazardous speculations and any trouble. They will never rub on the wrong side or assert themselves at the wrong moment.  
If Mars afflicts Sun or the ascendant, the nature of the person will be changed. He will become bombastic, domineering and blustering. He cannot be trusted in any department of life. If he marries anybody, he will prove to be unfaithful, amorous, disloyal, mean and short-tempered. Good aspect of Mars gives courage and grand success. Aspect of Mars and Saturn to Sun is very important. Adverse aspects will offer bitterest experiences in life. Remember the brightest light will always cast the deepest shadow.  
#### Weakness to be Corrected
Generally, Leonians do not consider both sides of a question. It is advisable for them to take into account other's views, ideas, and suggestions. Whenever Leonians are crossed, they become extroverted and may act aggressively, particularly during the sub-period of the planet that afflicts the Sun. It is important to remember that charity should begin at home, but over-liberality, which can leave one in a state of want, is also not desirable. The Sun never retrogrades and always moves forward, and Leonians should strive to do the same, without considering the past or future. It is important to be patient and not be hasty or get irritated before those whom they have helped show their gratitude. Leonians should avoid forcing conclusions at their own risk and not be arrogant. They should strive to maintain an attractive home and a comfortable-sized bank position, and not spend away all they have and all they get. Big enterprises will move slowly, so Leonians should not be hasty and take others' advice. They should consider both sides of a question, proceed steadily, and guard against the subtle influence of flattery. Leonians should not try to dominate all the time, as others will also desire freedom. They should be careful in their dress, but not be a slave to ever-changing fashion.  
#### Health and Disease
Generally, these people should have a strong constitution. Even if they become ill, they tend to recover quickly from any illness. However, they are easily alarmed when sickness overtakes them. Leo indicates the heart, the spinal column, spinal marrow nerves and fibers. Leo influences the bones, dorsal vertebrae, and interspinal muscles. Anterior and posterior coronary, aorta, and vena cava are ruled by Leo. Therefore, heart disease, palpitations, spinal meningitis, syncope, locomotor ataxia, inflammations, sunstroke, giddiness, and pestilence are other disorders. Epilepsy and rheumatic fever are diseases from which one may suffer when the ascendant is afflicted by Mars and Saturn, respectively. As Aquarius opposes Leo and Capricorn is the sixth sign counted from Leo, malefics in Capricorn and Aquarius can cause swelling in the ankle followed by heart disease. Jupiter in Leo will protect one from any surgical aid, but if Mars afflicts it, it can lead to coronary thrombosis or the need for surgical aid. As Leo rules the heart, which is the vital part of the body, temperate living is absolutely necessary. One has to avoid drinks, beverages, and stimulants, but one should take a balanced diet. That is why our ancestors were very particular about having a "sathvic" diet.
#### Finance and Fortune
Leo is symbolized by the lion, which is the king of the animals. Therefore, one's natural instinct is to always seek the highest position and, usually, one has it rightfully. One will try to deal with large issues and leave the routine, monotonous drudgery and minor details to subordinates. One is by nature a spendthrift, even when poverty may threaten them. One will be able to face any hard time. Generally, fortune favors Leonians when they are young and they will have sufficient resources. However, because they spend lavishly, their bank position will deteriorate as age advances. Leo being the fifth sign of the zodiac, one will be tempted to gamble and speculate. Luckily, their risks will amply reward them. Speculators are very liberal when they give gifts to others and do not hesitate to lend financial assistance to the needy. One will please themselves with the sweet smile of those to whom they present costly ones and will feel proud when they think that others borrow from them and approach them for a favor.
#### Profession
Sun, the ruler of this sign Leo, will influence in directing one's choice of profession. It favors high positions in commerce or government. As Leo is a fixed sign, one may have a fixed income, security of service under the government, etc. It is the fifth sign of the zodiac, so one earns through speculation, music, theatre, opera; being a fiery sign, one may be a jeweler, goldsmith, or one working in precious metals. As this sign gives executive ability and tireless application to work, one will be fit to manage great enterprises. Presidents, managers of corporations, managing directors of concerns, officials, superintendents, directors, captains, and sales managers are born in Leo. Planets forming favorable aspects specify the nature. If Mars is favorable, it makes one a soldier, surgeon, chemist, dentist, barber, butcher, worker in iron, copper, and with instruments; Mars and Leo favor the defense department and warlike pursuits. Mercury produces sales managers, share-brokers, ambassadors, counselors, auditors, engineers, architects, etc. Jupiter forming favorable aspect with Leo produces lawyers, judges, priests, bankers, and physicians. Venus in Leo indicates those in the administrative department of transport, travels, food, agriculture, and those who deal in glass, cloth, silk, provisions, and luxurious articles. Saturn favors mines, coal, wood, estates, lead, and plumber or menial posts. Thus, depending on the aspect received, the nature of the profession is to be judged.
#### Domestic Environments
The health of the native needs relaxation. Absolute peace, harmony, and happiness will keep them cheerful. Just as a king expects his subjects to be submissive and always favors them, Leonians will try to be the leader in the house and expect all those at home to be cooperative, obedient, and grateful. They want the members of the family to have a broad outlook and to be magnanimous and noble. Leonians choose their good friends and entertain them often. They never hesitate to spend money to maintain prestige and honor. Even when sandalwood is pulverized and thrown into fire, it does not lose its fragrance. So also, these people will never think of economy, even when they are driven to a state of poverty. They will lead the same aristocratic life and their home will be an impressive one. They will spend much on dress, screen cloth, curtains, furniture, etc. They will keep the home tidy with all the attractive trimmings, decoration, etc.  
If the male is born in one sign but the wife is born in Leo, then it is a problem for him to please her by supplying her dress, jewels, etc. If he does not satisfy her, readers can guess his fate. His home will be his Hell in this life. But if he is able to meet her demands, then his home is his Heaven.  
#### Romance, Marriage, and Married Life
The person born in Leo is romantic. They love deeply and they will be carried away by love. They cheer up the partner most skillfully like an actor in a comedy scene. They are an ideal lover, as they will be fiery and passionate. But they will never like any demonstration of love in public, as they consider it below their dignity. They will have abundant charm and be attractive to the opposite sex. It is but natural that the partner is jealous as the Leonian will be always in the midst of a crowd of ladies. Therefore, the partner should have proper understanding. They should share their pleasure when they give plenty of parties to others and have exciting times with them. Unless they have Saturn, Mars, and Venus in the ascendant, 5 or 7 or 11, they need not mistake the Leonian husband. If one understands them and agrees with them, they will be liked, loved, and admired by the person born in Leo. They will fit in the domestic routine admirably. They will never allow anybody to disrespect their wife or any member of their family. They are very proud of their family. They will not tolerate any ill-repute. They are always conscious of their social standing and are chivalrous.  
As Leo is a fiery sign, partners born in the same or the other two fiery signs, Aries or Sagittarius, or in any of the three airy signs, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius, will suit well. If one links their fortune with another born in Leo itself, it is advisable that both understand each other, so that there can be no trouble in their married life. Aries and Sagittarius born will contribute to their happiness and harmony. In the airy signs, Aquarius, Libra, and Gemini, persons born in Aquarius will be devoted to Leo borns. Brides born in Libra will ever try for company, avoid troubles, and purchase peace at any price. Ones born in Gemini will be very tactful and will never do anything which the husband may hate. The Geminian will be an inseparable partner and they will be sincere and affectionate.  
The Leo lady is ambitious and ideal. They will manage their home admirably. At the same time, they are successful social workers. They can make a favorable impression on all. Their devotion both to their home and to the general public is supreme. They will be offered prominent positions. They are self-sacrificing ladies with everlasting love. They cannot expect any good return from those to whom they lend their assistance at the risk of their own interests. A Leo bride marrying an Aries husband is lucky, as they have a commanding person so that they will know their limits and will not overstep in exercising their authority or in spending lavishly. They need one to keep them under control, so that they can appreciate their husband's good nature, affection, kindness, and real love to lead a pleasant, prosperous, and peaceful life. For, they will have pretty fixed ideas, and they will feel that their word is law, and will expect others to do only those which they desire and consider right.  
#### Children 
People born in Leo love their children most and are very proud of them. Generally, their children will be restless and may even be nervous, striking out for independence at a young age and disliking restriction. Leo-born parents should let their children feel that they rely on them, otherwise they will lose their confidence. Children born in Leo will try to lead and boss over the other children, proving to be good leaders with great vitality, ambition, and persistence. They will be popular because they do not desire to have honour for themselves by appropriating what others have done, being good-natured, obliging, and affectionate. They have courage and confidence to crown them with success.  
#### Handwriting
As the lord of Leo is the Sun, which is round and full of curves, the handwriting of people born in Leo will be marked by regular circles and will consume much space, with flourishes added to the words. They will write in straight and regular lines, with upright and vertical letters.
#### Lucky Days
Sundays are good for taking medicine, tonic, etc. to recoup health, to undertake any enterprise, to meet high officials, and to purchase items governed by the Sun. Mondays should be avoided, as they can lead to waste of money, loss of prestige, secret inimical activities, and irritation. Tuesdays are good for grand success in competitive examinations, and for purchasing property, cars, etc. and going on long journeys. Wednesdays are good for approaching bankers for overdrafts, entering into contracts, taking up agencies, signing documents, and registering. Thursdays are good for lending money, purchasing costly items for wives, and purchasing land and cars for children. Fridays are auspicious for short journeys, transfers, and promotions. Saturdays should be avoided, as they can lead to deception and fraud.

Orange, red, and green should be used. Blue and white should be avoided.

### Virgo - Kanni
Virgo is the sixth sign of the Zodiac, extending from the 150th degree from the Vernal Equinox (Aries - Mesha 0 degree) to the 180th degree. It is the second sign of the Zodiac ruled by Mercury, and the second earthy sign. It is a negative, feminine, barren, cold, dry, nocturnal, and northern sign, and it is of long ascension. Mercury is not only the ruler of this sign, but it is exalted here. Venus, though a good friend of Mercury, is debilitated in Virgo. Whenever the Sun, Moon, Mars, and Jupiter occupy this sign, they are said to be in an enemy's camp. Saturn alone is in a friend's quarters when it is in Virgo.  
Mercury's exaltation in this sign and Venus' debilitation here confirm that Mercurians prefer wisdom to wealth. Goddess Lakshmi and Goddess Saraswathi do not live together in one place. Both cannot co-exist. Spiritual wealth and knowledge, which Saraswathi bestows on us, is inexhaustible and no dacoit can rob it. The possessor never becomes a bankrupt; it is ever full and, if at all, it improves. This wisdom leads one to immortality, whereas material wealth may lead to immorality.  
Virgo is traditionally symbolised as Virgin-Mary. In the ancient Zodiac, it was symbolised as a Virgin, lying prostrate, in one of her hands she holds Spica - seed-wheat and in the other a stem of a tree. The capital of France still retains its name of Paris (Paras - Isis) under the protection of Isis-Virgo. Its great Cathedral bears the name Notre Dame (Our Lady).  
Leo French says, "Light dawns on chaos, whenever a son of Mercury is born. He should be cherished and forfended from any materialising or coarsening influence so far as possible, during childhood. The Virgo child shares this sensitiveness, though the expression thereof is somewhat different, the earthly element of Virgo giving the native reserve and diffidence, whereas the aerial essence of Gemini in its true, pristine birth nature is free from the curse of matter, self-consciousness. Gemini is timid and elusive, evasive in decadence. Virgo is shy and self-conscious.  
Even though Mercury may occupy its own sign, yet it is so different in Virgo from the other sign, Gemini, and so different is its effect on everything with which it comes in contact, that the casual astrological observer would not recognise the planet as the same Budha-Mercury.  
#### Physical Features
The native will be tall with a slender body, dark hair and eyes, curved eyebrows with much hair growth, a thin and even shrill voice, and they will walk quickly. They often appear younger than their actual age due to their activity, and they have a straight nose, indicating that they are very clever, not necessarily cunning. The forehead near the eyebrows will be pronounced, and the expression of their eyes will be honest and frank. Among Westerners, most of the Virgo-borns will have beautiful blue eyes (Venus is the ruler of the second sign).
#### Characteristics
Virgo is ruled by inconstant Mercury, so change is always desired. Most of you are forever changing your residence or jobs. Of all the people born in the 12 signs of the Zodiac, you Virgoans are very conscientious and capable of handling even unfavourable conditions. You will mark time and get prepared to handle it wisely. You have a commercial instinct that is ingrained. You will be very brisk and quick in your work, just like the fast-moving Planet Mercury. You will expect others to be brief in their statements and representation, and to be businesslike. But when you begin to talk or explain, you pay attention to the details of things, adding such wealth of detail that it can make others feel bored and vexed. You rarely come to the point quickly. If you are a drawing master, you will include all conceivable details.  
You are thorough and methodical. Your first thought and action will be sensible and rational. You are practical and discriminative. You may be careful but you are severely critical. Self-pity is one of your vices. You will be at your best if you are an inspector, auditor, income-tax officer, or examiner, as you are very good and quick at finding fault with others. If you have a weak Mercury in your horoscope, you are prone to dissatisfaction and if the task is difficult, you will give it up in despair. But if your Mercury is strong, you will go ahead and try to do perfectly whatever you undertake. You will be a genius, able to analyse, dissect, and go deep into the matter.  
Being an earthy sign, you will have the desire to save money. You will be prudent and always keep a small sum of money that none is aware of. If you travel, you will keep a part of your cash in one pocket, something in the other, and safely some more amount, with the idea of not spending it, in your suitcase. You will be so over-careful that you will not mind reopening the cover written by you just before posting it. You will verify once, twice, and thrice before you finish a work, thus avoiding mistakes.  
If you have to consult a doctor, you will sit down for hours, write a big history-sheet about your constitution to the last detail, try to recollect your old complaints, and present a big file to the doctor, even though your complaint is actually very simple. You are remarkable for keeping everything in its place properly and orderly. You will maintain accounts and the day-book with all details. You will keep personal files and all documents in perfect condition.  
Unfortunately your subordinates or servants at home will not be born in Virgo and will not be equally brisk and brilliant. So to the extent to which you expect them, they can never keep up and satisfy you. Virgo, being a feminine and earthy sign, you will take delight in horticulture, agriculture, gardening, etc. It is said that Virgo, Gares (Demeter) is the goddess of agriculture and of legislation and social order. You are governed much by intellect as Mercury gets exalted here. You will not be sympathetic, as Venus gets debilitated in this sign. Saturn, aspecting Virgo, will make you lazy and fond of taking things easy. But you derive pleasure in driving others and be very masterful with subordinates.
Being a common sign, there will be changes in your environments, and you will form associations and friendships.  
Mercury shows that you will be fond of studying science, and particularly about medicine, food, diet, hygiene, etc., being the sixth sign of the Zodiac. Mercury as lord of the 6th sign, called the Hospital of Zodiac, indicates that if ever you fall ill, you lack the will-power and will often brood over the disease, imagine too much, never cheer yourself up, to get you out of the clutches of your illness. Thus, you will be ruining your health. Further, you will always look for sympathy. But at the same time, when you are healthy, if anybody falls ill, you will prove to be a very good nurse.  
Neptune in Virgo gives a scheming mind. One may be a deceptive individual and be interested in illicit pleasure. Neptune in the exact cusp produces thieves, cunning, and most diplomatic scoundrels. Uranus in Virgo Ascendant makes one clever, learned, and versatile. You may be employed as a teacher, a writer, a superintendent, or an excise officer. Uranus always offers a research mind. Virgo gives an analytical nature. Hence, many research scholars are born in Virgo having good aspects with Uranus. Great musicians, statisticians, journalists, and scientists are also born under such favourable positions.  
#### Characteristics to be Corrected
The native's nature is to be very chatty and analytical. In conversation, they will give lengthy descriptions, including all meticulous details which can be boring to others. They will be restless until they pass their remarks and criticize others' faults and idiosyncrasies. Even members of their family may not appreciate their comments and criticism. They should avoid too much analysis over even minor things and should not have nervousness and self-doubt. Though they may be intelligent and have quick perception, they will need steadiness in going after what they want. They should also avoid changeability and should not proceed to another work until the earlier one is completed. They should not ask for everyone's advice about a situation and get so confused and uncertain that nothing is accomplished. They should trust their own judgement and intelligence and not seek advice from others. If they do consult a doctor or an astrologer, they should pin their faith on one and take their advice. If they consult many, they will be confused. They should stick to a single person's advice which will be the best. They should develop true consistency of purpose, learn to forget others' mistakes, and forgive them for their faults. They should not have long sustained resentment.  
#### Health
You are normally a temperate person and live sensibly, so you enjoy robust health with long life and healthy old age. When you are young, you will be very active and appear much younger due to your activity. You are also very particular about your diet, so you do not fall ill often. However, planets afflicting your Ascendant can cause digestive and intestinal troubles. People with malefics in Virgo often suffer from dysentery, typhoid, and sprue during their periods. Malefics in Virgo suggest that you need plenty of rest and calm surroundings, and you must have lots of exercise, especially when your Ascendant is afflicted. Your weak points physically are your nervous system and your stomach, both of which are sensitive. Hence, if you include much of Vitamin B in your diet, you can avoid these troubles and have regular meals. You should also try to have a balanced diet. Illness may be very minor, but due to your imagination, you may exaggerate it and make yourself unhappy. As Virgo-borns have Saturn as lord of 6 and Mars as lord of 8, it is observed that they will have minor injuries very often, and it is likely that they meet with accidents. Therefore, do not be rash.  
As Virgo indicates abdomen and bowels, and as it is ruled by Mercury which has influence over the nervous system, disorders of the bowels can react on the mental condition. Further, disturbed mental status, business as well as domestic worries, can reflect adversely on the bowels. Hypochondria is indicated by this sign. The functions of Virgo are absorption, assimilation, selection and utilisation. Its action is chylifactive. A vegetarian diet, well-proportioned, is preferred. You should avoid worries, discontentment, irritability, and short temper. Normally, you will have few temptations for excess. High living and deep drinking should also be avoided. Be on guard against gall-stones. Avoid alcohol. But you will always remember "An apple a day, will keep the doctor away".    
#### Finance
As you possess a sound commercial instinct, you are normally careful about your money. You have the great desire to become rich and hence you are very conscious about the value of money. You do not usually come by fortune and much of wealth. You will work hard, and the remuneration will not be satisfactory, as the lord of 6 is Saturn. Investments also will not prove to be good, as the returns will be poor. You may have many ups and downs. It is only through your own talent and hard work that you will be able to come to the top.
#### Profession
People born in Virgo should make a correct choice of their financier or partner in business. He should select one with much enthusiasm and courage. He will use short-cut methods; you will worry about minor details and get discouraged now and then. But the partner should be one who always cheers you up and makes the best use of your intelligence. Generally you become a slave to your work; you are also a hard taskmaster. You will prefer to be left alone to carry out your work in a quiet place peacefully.  
Sun, forming good aspect with lord of 2 or 6 or 10 in Virgo, indicates that you may be a successful medical officer. You may work in the Medical or Public Health department. Also, you can get into Government service in Engineering, Auditing, Teaching, etc. Mars also forming good aspect, denotes that one can have their own nursing home or deal in scientific instruments, appliances, etc.  
Moon, forming good aspect with lord of 2 or 6 or 10 in Virgo, shows that one may be employed in the Engineering or Accounts department in Shipping, Port Trust or Navy, or in those concerns dealing in liquids, like petrol, mercury etc. Also, it is shown that one may be serving in the Textile department, inks, inkstands, pens may be manufactured.  
Mars, forming good aspects with lord of 2 or 6 or 10 suggests that you may interest yourself in the Press printing, editing, publishing, writing, or serve as a clerk in any industry or in the Defense department; be a surgeon or independent auditor or one working in the Military accounts, or be a mechanical engineer or a military engineer. It is also likely that you may serve in the expansion of plants for steel, fertiliser, agricultural implements, etc. If Mars is also afflicted, one will amass wealth by black-market or by committing theft or robbery.  
A warning to such people is necessary. A few of your servants may have venomous tongue, and by doing propaganda of false libels. Somehow, they will manage to have confidential information from their friends in their unguarded moments, and be going on exploiting the friends, who have to give money, simply to please such undesirable persons. Otherwise, you will get into trouble. Therefore, it is advisable to scrutinise the horoscope of at least the Private Secretary, so that you can avoid such troubles later, when Mars and Mercury conjointly operate. They will have the courage even to come to the court, and give witness against you. It is a pleasure for such persons to turn hostile and spoil you and similar higher officials, if Mars forms disharmonious aspect with Mercury.  
Mercury forming good aspect, shows that you will be a broker, book-keeper, accountant, teacher, lawyer, or pharmacist. You may be the author of many books. You may become a good journalist. You may be an interpreter, Registrar or letter carrier. You will have the desire to study all problems in minute details, and solve them in your own way, as you are good on devices and systems. As a lawyer, you will be successful in cross-examination.  
Jupiter, forming good aspect with the lords of 2, 6 or 10 in Virgo, indicates that you may have literary, scientific, or any other intellectual pursuit. You may be a publisher, editor, or a journalist. Religion, law, insurance, investment, or speculation, may also be your profession. You may work in Religious Endowment Board or temple or church, in law courts, banks, etc. It is likely that you will work in any embassy, or go out as an ambassador.  
Venus, forming good aspect, shows that you will be a good musician, actor, painter, or artist. You may be engaged in making toilet accessories, manufacturing women clothing, etc. You may deal in all articles needed for personal adornment. Confectioners, caterers, bakers, restaurant keepers and perfumery dealers are also born in Virgo, having favourable aspect from Venus, or when it occupied Virgo at the time of birth, as Venus is lord of 2.  
Saturn (lord of 6), forming a beneficial aspect with Venus, lord of 2, and with Mercury, lord of 10, in Virgo, or when Saturn was in Virgo at the time of birth, one will have competence in mathematics, statistics, accounts, physics, dynamics, etc. You will serve in mines or engineering departments. You may engage in exporting mine ore. You may hold responsible posts and positions of trust. As you will be industrious and methodical, you will thrive in business. You are likely to serve in the Finger Print Office, if Mars also aspects, as Mars indicates Police and Crime.   
Uranus indicates that one may serve in the railway, electricity, election, or nutrition research departments. Jupiter, forming strong beneficial aspects, will offer the native the post of Finance Minister, and not Revenue Minister, as the latter is to collect money for the Government, whereas the former is to spend away, and also to borrow, whenever needed. Virgo being the sixth sign of the Zodiac, and as the 6th house shows debts and dispute, he will be the minister for election, or be serving in the Election department. A few may work in the Aviation department or Census office.   
Neptune, forming a good aspect with lord of 2, 6, or 10 in the Ascendant Virgo, indicates that you may serve in big industries, tea estates, export and import departments, or in shipping.  
#### Domestic Environments
Wanderlust is your nature. You will often change your residence to have a change in scenery and neighborhood, just like those born under the sign of Cancer. You want to keep everything in your home in order and expect your people to work methodically, putting on a show when guests are invited. You insist on keeping everything neat, saying, "A place for everything and everything in its place". You prefer to entertain others in your home, but you do not return their visits. As Jupiter is the lord of the fourth house, you will always be lucky in procuring houses to live in. Even when you invest in buildings, you will be able to purchase them in a good locality. The value of the property will increase during the period of Jupiter. However, Saturn being the lord of the 5th and 6th houses, and Mars the lord of the 8th house, they show that there may be losses in investments during the joint periods of Saturn and Mars. It is advisable for Virgoans to dispose of their holdings during their Jupiter periods, when the price will be higher, whether it is investment shares or land. Otherwise, a necessity will arise during the following Saturn's period, and it will be disposed of at a loss, and you will be depressed.  
Jupiter is not only lord of 4th but also the lord of the 7th house. Hence, your partner in life will be God-fearing, religious, law-abiding, and true. Therefore, you will have a peaceful and pleasant domestic life.  
#### Friends and benefactors
You have your own peculiarities. You prefer only intelligent people who have a good future, and you will offer your assistance only to them. The defect in you is that you expect them to say "Thanks" before you actually render your help, and also gain a "Thanks" after you have done it. You expect them to mention in many words that they want and appreciate your friendship. Normally, you do not mix with all people; you make your choice. You feel delicate to approach strangers for any help you need. You want friends and you cannot do anything for them with pleasure, unless they recognize, approve, and appreciate. You need friends more for this purpose. Just as you have the desire to change residence, etc., so also you will form friendships with new persons. The 11th house indicates benefactors. The 11th house is ruled by the Moon, which is also inconstant. People born on Mondays, Rohini, Hastham, and Sravanam star days, or in Cancer, will be good friends indeed.
#### Romance and Marriage
You have your own ideals. To find one suiting to your taste is difficult. Therefore, there will be a long delay in choosing one to measure up to your ideal, as everything must be perfect, as far as you are concerned. It is likely that, in the first few cases, you will be disappointed. Whenever you desire to make a selection, you attach more value to intelligence than to the pleasure in romance. Further, you are often shy, and do not demonstrate your affection. You should not be so touchy. For a happy life with your wife, to some extent, you should give expression to your affection. You should remember that love demands good understanding, and it cannot stand any criticism. Your temperament is to find fault with others. That you must give up. Just as you expect others to appreciate your assistance or intelligence, so also, whether the person whom you love is equally intelligent or not, you have to simply admire her beauty (even though she is not very fair) and her company and give expression to it. Virgoans are rarely passionate. By conversation, at least, they should keep the partner cheerful, and also get such books for her to read.  
A male born in Virgo will lead the married life more on a partnership basis, although it is a business or as a part of the social scheme. That is why many people born in Virgo postpone their time of marriage and prefer to be a bachelor for a long time. Your desire is more to be studious and to be doing research work in a peaceful atmosphere. But, when once you get married, you make all provision for your wife and the other members of your family. It is likely that you may be often complaining about your health which you should avoid. As Mercury rules this sign, you have a nervous active manner. You will consider the nervous tensions as actual symptoms of some illness, and you not only worry within yourself, but cause more worry to your partner and others.  
Luckily, the partner's ruling planet will be Venus, lord of 2, or Jupiter, lord of the 7th house, or Moon, lord of the 11th house. As all three are benefics by nature, and give fertile imagination to the partner, she will be able to understand you properly and conduct herself wisely, giving always encouragement to you whenever you need it. It is the good nature of your wife, i.e., adjustability, accommodation, and good understanding that will be responsible for your happy life with such a dutiful wife.  
Virgo-borns will be peevish and occasionally mean; they are so thrifty that their husbands will become economical within a few years after marriage. Her idea of marriage is a legal partnership, and that she should live in a business-like way. She will run the home in a very regulated routine manner, without herself wasting anything nor allowing others to waste or be extravagant. She will attend to her duties quickly and most satisfactorily. But, she will not be able to please her husband in spiritual life or in keeping pleasant company. She will cling to the idea that sex is mean, base, and one day or other troublesome. A clever partner has to change her frame of mind, and should not mistake her.  
#### Children
People born in Virgo will have a limited number of children, as the 5th house is ruled by Saturn. They may also have to spend much on their studies, necessitating Virgoans to borrow, as the lord of the 5th house is also the lord of the 6th. It is also indicated that Virgo people may borrow and invest in landed properties, which will be later enjoyed by their children. Even though they may not show their affection to them, Virgoans will never fail in their duty to train them, give them proper education, and make them fit enough to hold any post admirably in their official career. Among their children, the eldest will be plodding, persevering, and patiently working and prospering, while the second and third children will maintain good health and enjoy fortune with less effort.
#### Handwriting
Virgoans are governed by strong Mercury, so they may write in between two lines, i.e., above the line. They will develop the upper part of the letters. The lines written by them will be short, sharp, and also include upwards. They always use sharp pointed nibs, and hence, their writing will be thin. They do not waste ink by putting loops, etc. and avoid underlining their signature, more to save time. If at all they underline, Mercury, lord of the sign, shows that they will do it twice.
#### Lucky Day
Virgoans' ruling planet is Mercury, who owns both the Ascendant and the most powerful, effective, and successful house, the 10th, i.e., the meridian. Therefore, Wednesday, governed by Mercury, will be the most lucky day for them. Even though Venus gets debilitated in this sign, as she rules the second and ninth houses, Bagya Sthana, Fridays will bring fortune. Mars, ruling the third and eighth houses, indicates that Tuesdays are inauspicious, especially for speculation, betting, short travels, or correspondence, and for signing any important document. Saturdays are not beneficial, as they threaten with delay, denial, and disappointment. Sundays will end in a loss. Mondays are good to meet friends, make new friendships, bet, speculate, and ever gain. Thursdays are favourable to invest, to buy cars, etc., also to commence romance, or start a family and life with a wife in new quarters. It is also very good to form partnerships in business and expand one's enterprise.
#### Lucky Colour
Green, white, and yellow. Avoid red and blue. When Virgoans put on red and blue only, their health fails, and they meet with minor injuries and face difficulties. The moment they give them up, there will be no more evil. Putting on white shows fortune, green ones and emerald show promotion in official life, and also prosperity in business. Yellow ones are good for happy domestic environments.
#### Lucky Numbers
5, 14, 23, 32, 41, etc. 2, 11, 20, 38, 47, etc. 7, 16, 25, 34, 43, etc. 6, 15, 24, 33, 42, etc. 3, 12, 21, 30, 48, etc.
#### Lucky Stone
Emerald, pearl, diamond, and yellow sapphire. Virgoans are generally fortunate in those years when Jupiter gets exalted in Cancer. It is certain that Jupiter, transiting in the constellation Aslesha, will offer the most beneficial results to them, as Aslesha is ruled by Mercury, the lord of the 1st and 10th houses, and it is in the 11th house which promises pleasure, profit, permanent ties of friendship, and fulfillment of one's cherished desires.
#### Objects Indicated by Virgo
Gardens, both wet and dry lands, corn fields, granaries, grain elevators, restaurants, pantries, places where fruits and vegetables are kept, the storeroom, also book shelves, first aid box, medical box, libraries, closets, dairies, etc.
#### Countries
Turkey, Croatia, Mesopotamia, Babylon, Assyria, the locality between Tibet and the Euphrates, Greece, Thessaly, Corinth, Monz, Switzerland, Lower Silesia, Brazil, Virginia, and West Indies.
#### Towns
Jerusalem, Navarre, Paris, Brazil, Padua, Lyons, Toulouse, Reading, Baghdad, Cheltenham, Norwich, Todmorden, Boston, Brindisi, Corinth, and Los Angeles.

### Libra - Thulam
Libra is the 7th sign of the Zodiac and is 30 degrees in longitude, extending from the 180th degree from the Vernal Equinox (Aries-Mesha 0') to 210'. The commencement of Libra, i.e., the 180th degree, is termed the Autumnal Equinox and is a crossing place or intersection of the ecliptic and celestial equator. The sun passes over from north to south declination and at the time when the Sun enters 0 of Libra, the night and the day are equal throughout the world. Hindus celebrate this and call it Thula Masam. The old Mexicans and Egyptians also celebrate this and have feasts on this day. Chitra, second half (third and fourth padas), Swathi, and Visaka one, two and three padas are contained in this sign, Thulam.  
Libra is the 7th sign of the Zodiac and is governed by Venus. It is the 2nd airy sign and is said to be the day house or Moola Trikona sign of Venus. The 1st sign of Venus, Taurus-Rishaba, is an earthy sign, whereas Libra is an airy sign. Taurus-Rishaba is a fixed sign, whereas Libra is a movable (chars) sign. Libra is a positive sign and not negative like Taurus. Alan Leo calls Libra the equalising sign of the Zodiac and it is signified as the sign of the balance.  
Saturn is exalted in Libra and the Sun is debilitated. Moon, Mars and Jupiter, when they occupy this sign, are said to be in the enemy's camp. Libra is symbolised by a man stationed in a public market, holding a balance in his hand and dealing in his commodities. It is called the sign of Vyapari, Vaisyas-Businessmen. It is the human biped sign of long ascension.  
#### Physical features
The person born with Libra as ascendant grows tall with a well-proportioned body. Their limbs will be slender but strong. Their appearance will be graceful with a sweet smile and their countenance attractive. The eyebrows add to their beauty. In the adult age, the occipital region gets bald. The nose will be a little bent like the parrot.
#### Characteristics
As Libra is symbolized with balance, Librans will be level-headed; they can maintain mental equilibrium, weigh the merits and demerits, and pass a dispassionate opinion. They are the best judges. While they debate, they excel others in comparing and contrasting. They are constructive critics. Venus, the ruler of this sign, makes the native courteous, modest, and gentle. He is always for a happy and harmonious life and will not rub on the wrong side. He will purchase peace at any cost and will be upright and sympathetic. Even when he loses his temper, he will soon be quietened. He tries to lead a pleasant life, enjoying all the fruits of life. He is fond of dress, perfumeries, art, and music. Venus shows that Librans will have hobbies and, being a movable sign, they will be changing from one to another. Photography, gardening, drawing, painting, embroidery, etc. may be their hobbies.  
As Libra is the sign opposite to Aries, the Librans will forego their personal comforts but work hard for the benefit of others. Politicians born in Libra will be popular throughout life, whereas Aries-borns will be in power during beneficial periods and be nowhere during adverse days. Libra is an airy sign, so it confers fertile imagination, correct intuition, brilliant intellect, admirable refinement, supreme indemnity, pleasant nature, etc. He will be a proper adviser to plan anything with correct forethought. As Saturn gets exalted here, one can concentrate, meditate, and reach a higher plane in spiritual life also. Sri Narasimha Bharathi, Sri Ramana Maharishi, the sages, and the successful politicians who universally commanded all the people uniformly throughout life, like Mahatma M. K. Gandhi, were born in Libra.  
Further, these people do not believe in hot discussions; but they will try to bring about compromise in all controversial matters. This is one of the main reasons why they come to the front, become popular, and prosperous. Another good quality in them is that they have an unassuming nature and humanitarian instincts. Even when they commit any mistake, it is such that will be easily forgiven. They generally lean more to the spiritual side than to the pure physical one.  
As Libra is a masculine sign and the seventh of the Zodiac (seventh house indicates marriage partner), the Librans have such strong conjugal affection that they do not consider anything else more important than this pleasure. This is the difference between Leo-borns and Librans. Librans are very affectionate and gentle. They are easy-going, remarkably shrewd, and never hurt others' feelings. They will not bully and bluster. They are persuasive. Being a masculine sign, one cannot impose upon Librans, who will defeat the opponent by adopting a peaceful and strategic plan. They are accomplished diplomats.  
The Librans enjoy life immensely in the company of the opposite sex. Mars, as lord of 2, offers "no fears". Hence, they argue with clarity and forethought. They have the capacity to handle any situation tactfully. Neat touch and fine finish are the traits of Librans. They have warmth and charming manners, so that they happen to be the peace-makers. Venus, the lord of the sign, indicates that Librans will take interest in their dress, furniture, conveyance, and other comforts. The number one concern for them is to keep the partner always in good cheer. The partner will attach importance to the spirit of love among the two, whereas Librans care more for the surrounding conditions.  
Venusians generally like music, especially romantic music, if Venus or Libra receives aspects from Mars. Saturn, aspecting or occupying Libra, shows interest in tragic ones. Jupiter indicates prayers. Moon shows melody and they will keep the audience spell-bound.  
#### Characteristics to be corrected
Generally, Libra-borns gain materially either through fortune or the goodwill and generosity of an affectionate and influential associate. Therefore, they must keep their emotions in check and not allow things to get out of hand. They should also avoid appointing the opposite sex as their private secretary, as this will waste much of their time. Librans often mix business and pleasure, which need not be elaborated. Furthermore, they should try to take quick decisions, as many ideas will flash in their mind quickly. They should also avoid copying mannerisms from others and gaudiness. As Librans are unassuming and amiable, others may try to fool them; they should deal with such associates carefully, but remember to forgive, though not to forget. Librans may feel that every new occasion demands a new dress, and thus spend much on costumes, not realising that God has given them charm and that adornment is not required in their case.
#### Health
Generally, Librans have good physical structure, but they lack normal immunity and resistance to infectious diseases, making them susceptible to such illnesses. To prevent this, they must take preventive measures. Libra is associated with the kidneys, loins, and spines, so one can expect defects in the kidneys, pain in the spines, and other issues. For women, the uterus may be affected. When Libra is associated with a disease, one may suffer from appendicitis, lumbago, and polyuria.
#### Finance and Fortune
Librans are best suited for business with a partner, as they excel in reasoning, logic, foresight, and judgment. They can provide the right advice at the right time. They are also well-suited for law, as they are admirable critics. The tenth house, ruled by the Moon, suggests that their occupation may involve liquids, such as druggists, chemists, painters, engineers in hydro-electric systems, transport, navy, or those dealing in food, milk, or juicy fruits. As Libra is an airy sign ruled by Venus, those born in this sign or with Libra as one of the houses (2, 6, 10) from the ascendant may be story writers, playback musicians, architects, nursery owners, or those in the airways service. Librans have an irresistible power of persuasion, making them good salesmen, liaison officers, and receptionists.
#### Expenses
Librans have a different idea of what is needed, which can lead to extravagance. They spend on luxuries and curios, and are rarely economical. As a result, a lot of money may pass through their hands. They are generous and liberal, and will donate to good causes.
#### Domestic Environment
Their family life will be happy because Librans try to maintain peace. Their houses will be well-furnished and all luxuries will be made available. Decorations, designs, and paintings will be of high standard. Costly ornaments will be in their possession. They always prefer to lead pleasant lives and enjoy all the fruits of life. They love their home, family, and property. Generally, the parents of natives born in Libra will rush home from their office, mostly to spend time at home with their little group. They will not normally give interviews to their subordinates or customers at their residence; they will finish everything in their office.
#### Friends and Benefactors
The Librans are ever-lasting good friends to all those who come in contact with them. For they are honest, just, kind, courteous, and generous; they easily make friendships with others. Without friends, they cannot pass their time. Sun, as lord of 11, shows that they will have much to do with government servants, officials, etc. They will lead mostly a public life with both social and financial success. As they do not hurt others, even when their friends misbehave, they quickly forgive. So naturally, they gain ultimately. Socially, they are always in great demand. Well-aspected Sun gives them benefit through those born on Sundays or in Leo Ascendant, or Karthikai, Uthra Palguni or Uthrashadha star days. They will waste money on those born on Punarvasu, Visakha, Poorva Pathrapada stars and Aslesha, Jyeshta, and Revathi stars. For people born in these six stars cannot be helpful.
#### Romance and Marriage
Librans are the most lovable people for sex-life. For, they are experts in all love affairs. By this sincere love, they capture their partners. Besides, their dress, fashion, pleasant perfumery, and sweet smile are very enticing. Librans' passion grows suddenly and dies out quickly being a movable sign. But, at the time the Libran enjoys, they enjoy immensely in the company of the opposite sex. Being pleasant conversationalists, they put their argument with clear vision as they find pleasure in good discussions. Girls born in Libra are ready to let the male do all the disagreeable ones. They like to do such acts and will never fail to thank with a smile.  
Librans marry early in their life. They preserve the tradition. They are happy both at home and also in social life. Their standard of living being high, sometimes they cannot have a partner who can satisfy them.  
Libra girls are intelligent, tactful, and wise. They avoid hot discussions and try to maintain peace. Libra ladies lead luxurious lives. They love and adore their partners.  
Libra men are cheerful, happy, compassionate, and adjusting. They will accommodate to a good extent. They will provide the family with all necessaries, comforts, luxuries, and conveniences. They are highly passionate and they reach the greatest heights in expressing their love. If, per chance, the response is not to their expectation, they feel very much disappointed. But generally, they do not seek divorce but try to adjust. As houses 2, 7, and 11 indicate the partner in life and the house 2 and 7 are ruled by Mars and 11 by Sun, the partner in life will be short-tempered and rash. They may listen to the Librans but do just as they desire. They will be mostly of Martian type. Hence Libra-borns have to tone down the partner's fiery nature and by their diplomacy and tact, maintain peace at home. Those who are born in Gemini and Aquarius will match the Librans very well. Pisces, Capricorn, and Cancer will not agree with them. Librans will manage with others.  
#### Children
Since the fifth house is ruled by the planet Saturn, normally the Libra-borns will have a limited number of children. As Saturn is a dutiful planet, the children of Libra-borns will help them in their old age. Librans, by their charm and pleasing manners, can see that the children carry out their instructions with pleasure. If children are born in the exalted sign of Saturn, i.e. Libra, they will be renowned for their diplomacy. They will never quarrel. They will pay heed to others, understand their views, and try to adopt them if they suit them. They are never 'extremes'. They are moderate. They cannot be partial. They are very polite and modest. They know to always say 'yes' and they avoid saying 'no' to anybody.
#### Lucky Day
Sundays and Mondays are the successful days, when you will be fortunate. Saturdays show ultimate and grand success as it owns both the Kendhra and Kona houses and it becomes a benefic by lordship. Tuesdays are auspicious for competition, litigation, election, and speculation. Sudden and unexpected advantages will occur on those days. Wednesdays show long journeys, contact with foreigners, feasts, social functions, and pleasant expenses. Thursdays are evil; there will be misunderstanding with cousins, colleagues, and others. But this day is auspicious to apply for overdraft facility, etc. Fridays offer mixed results.
#### Lucky Colour
Orange, white, and red. Green and yellow should be avoided. Orange colour gives easy gain without any pain. Pearls and orange are favourable for speculative profit. Do not use blue when you speculate. Blue will assist your opponent as Capricorn and Aquarius are the 10th and 11th houses to the opponent indicated by Aries. Red colour is good for marriage and competition. Yellow threatens misunderstanding and dispute. Green shows only withdrawal of money and deterioration of bank position.
#### Lucky Number
1, 10, 19, 28, 37, etc.; 4, 13, 22, 31, 40, etc.; 2, 11, 20, 29, 38, 47, etc.; 7, 16, 25, 34, 43, etc. Number 5 is for loss; 6 also threatens success to opponent; 8 indicates investment and profit to one with whom Librans transact; 3 brings enmity; 9 may lead to litigation. But finally, it promises success. Some are of opinion that Venus being the lord of the ascendant, Friday Number 6, and diamond are lucky. But it is not correct as Venus rules the 8th house also (although in Jataka Chandrika it is said that Venus does not become a malefic by owning the 8th house). Experience has shown that this rule applies only to longevity and not for any other aspect in one's life. So Venus as lord of 8 will throw obstacles; one may have any danger due to the lordship of the 8th house. As lord of the ascendant, it saves. But Venus does not give a smooth life.
#### Objects Indicated by Libra
Libra indicates the prices of cotton and textiles, silks and fabrics like rayons, linen, nylon; and also the prices of wheat, jute, canes, and grains. Finished goods and foodstuffs are indicated by Virgo.
#### Places
Libra denotes sawpits, ground near windmills, outhouses, inner chamber, sides of hills, places having a pure, clear, sharp air, mountain tops, etc.
#### Towns
Antwerp, Nottingham, Leeds, Frankfurt, Lisbon, Vienna, Charles Town, Petrograd, Copenhagen, Spires, Playenya Fribourg, Suessa, Johannesburg, and Gaeta.
#### Countries
Northern Provinces of India, Burma, Mo-China, China, Argentina Republic, parts of Tibet, Upper Egypt, Libya, Uzbek, Savoy, Austria, Bactrianna, and Livonia.

### Scorpio or Vrischika
Scorpio is the 8th sign of the Zodiac, extending from the 210th degree from the Vernal Equinox (Aries Mesha 0) to 240. The Sun will be moving away from the celestial equator towards the south. The constellation or the nakshathras Visakam 4th quarter, Anuradha, and Jyeshta are contained in this sign, Vrischika. The concluding part of this sign, Kataka and Meena, is termed Bhasandhi and Riksha Sandhi.  
Scorpio is the 2nd sign of Mars: the first sign governed by Mars is a barren, masculine, positive, cardinal, movable, fiery sign; the second is a fruitful, fixed, Sthira, feminine yet violent and a watery sign. It is of long ascension. Mars is the ruler of this sign. No planet gets exalted in this sign, but Moon becomes weakened and is debilitated. Scorpio is the sign of detriment to Venus. Modern scholars assign Scorpio as the exalted sign of Uranus (but considering the qualities of Uranus, it appeals to me that it would be appropriate to allot Virgo as the exalted sign to Uranus, just like Mercury). Sun and Jupiter are said to be in friend's quarters if they occupy Scorpio. Saturn, Mercury, and Venus are considered to be in enemy's camp when they pass in Scorpio.  
Scorpio is symbolised by a Scorpion. In snakes, there are venomous and non-venomous ones, but in Scorpions, there is no non-venomous one. All are evil. That is why Vrischika is called "Keeta" meaning reptile, representing the Poisonous scorpion. It is a centified sign. Hebrews ascribed Scorpio to Dan, a serpent. Originally, the banner of the Israel tribes was a Scorpion. Later, it was replaced by an Eagle. In Arabia, it is called "Al Akrab", meaning dispute and war; rupture and fall are attributed to Scorpio.  
Scorpio represents two types. The higher Scorpion type people have control over their senses ("Jithainthriyas"). That is why Lord Krishna stands on the venomous head of the "Kalinga" snake and keeps it under control. The lower type people will be jealous of others and rude. These are the indefatigable seekers after sensuous pleasure. They have strong will and they are irreconcilable. They know how to control others but they cannot control themselves and their senses.  
#### Physical Features
The body of a Scorpio is generally well-proportioned, with long hands and an above-average stature. They have a broad face, a commanding appearance, short and curly hair, and a muscular body. They have a good personality.
#### Characteristics
Scorpio is a fixed sign, making Scorpios particularly determined individuals. When they set a goal, they will not hesitate to plunge into the business and will not give up until they reach their target. They have a fertile imagination and sharp intelligence, and are full of dynamic energy when they are set into action. They have intense feelings and emotions, and remarkable intuition, making them successful in medical and financial fields. Mars, the owner of the sign, gives them self-assertion, impulsive action, courage, resolution, independence, excitement, and forcefulness. They are extremists, and can be both practical and reckless. They have a tendency to over-ride and keep others under control, and can quickly lose their temper. They are highly sexed, and may be drawn to the mysterious and psychic subjects. They hate gossip and loose talk, and are brief and choose their words carefully. They often put off things to the last moment, but are successful in the end. They do not interfere in others' matters, but will be revengeful and relentless if they feel betrayed. They are true, loyal, faithful, and reliable, but will keep one item of importance undisclosed. They can be cunning, and will always have a trump card to save themselves.
#### Characteristics to Be Corrected
Do not pass sarcastic remarks. Expect all your subordinates to be as clever and hardworking as you are, but do not be overly critical. Control yourself whenever you lose your temper. Try to avoid creating secret enmity with the ladies. Do not stand for foul play. Even if you lose, accept the loss; wait, and shortly you will regain what you have lost. Do not be selfish.
#### Health
Scorpio governs the generative organs, the bladder, which can cause disease; if they occupy Scorpio, they can affect the bladder, womb, ovaries, etc. Jupiter and Mars in Scorpio can lead to trouble by enlargement of the prostate gland. Venereal disease is the main disease caused by Scorpio. Stone in the bladder is mostly caused by Saturn. For people born in Scorpio, the 6th house from it is the sign which indicates the disease; therefore, the disease signified by Aries, the planets occupying Aries, those in the constellation of the occupants, those in the constellation of the lord of 6, and Mars can cause ailments. Therefore, affections of the brain, insomnia, neuralgia, coma, trance, inflammation, obsession, and somnambulism are signified by Aries.  
Scorpio being a fixed sign, the Moon is not only a Rajayoga adhipathi but also a Bhadhaka Sthana adhipathi. Therefore, the Moon can cause anxious ill-health to those born in Scorpio. Jupiter and Venus are Maraka Sthana adhipathis. (6th house disease; 2, 7, and 8 danger).
#### Finance and Fortune
Scorpio indicates chemistry, medicine, insurance, maternity, beverage, breweries, boilers, steam engines, automobiles, mines, military, water supply, dam construction, tools, machinery, slaughterhouses, labour department, tea, coffee, tobacco, copper, tin, parboiled rice, jaggery, mine ores, horses, and elephants, to excavate and catch elephants, etc. Greatest surgeons, chemists, research workers, detectives, and intelligent workers are born in this sign. Soldiers, dentists, barbers, butchers, those who work with iron and steel, rail loading, applied mechanics, military, and naval activity are also indicated by Scorpio. Generally, Scorpio-borns are lucky when it comes to money. In speculation, they will invariably gain, as the lord of 2 is also the lord of 5. Eventually, their income will be substantial. They are always lucky in anything they want, such as vehicles, wives, businesses, houses, gardens, and cattle, etc. They know how to make money, but they do not know how to save it. They are extravagant. They will be very kind and generous to them.
#### Domestic Environment
For your life to be jolly and successful in your career, environment plays a vital part. You want others to implicitly follow whatever you say in any matter, but you do not want anyone to boss over you. You are happy to boss over others and you cannot lead your life without all comforts and conveniences. You often spend beyond your capacity, expecting some income, and you will spend away in advance, wait for the returns, and repay the loan. You want to design your home to your taste and, even during adverse periods, you accept the situations and turn them to your advantage, creating happiness and proving to be successful and happier than others placed under similar conditions.
#### Friends and Benefactors
Scorpio-borns can become very intimate with someone in a short period of time when they make a friendship, but if there is any friction, they can become a worse enemy. Because of this, Scorpio-borns do not have life-long friends. However, the friends they choose will be in positions of power and authority, or they will be influential. If someone adjusts and gets close to them, they can benefit from them and can expect a permanent tie of friendship. You should not be violent and should accept others' arguments. You should not show that you are convinced, but if you correct yourself, you will be very popular. Lower type Scorpio-borns will be notorious. Every action has a reaction and everyone is repaid in the same coin. The 11th house indicates friends and benefactors, and Mercury rules the 11th sign and also governs the 8th house. Therefore, Mercurians will not mind letting you down and bringing you disgrace if you make their friendship, be a good friend for some period, and then rub them on the wrong side. Therefore, do not take anyone into your confidence and at any unguarded moment leak out any of your secret matters.
#### Romance and Marriage
Scorpio-borns have complex moods; yet they are intense, dynamic, and energetic in romance and love affairs. Unless they have sympathy, good understanding, and steady affection and try to cultivate it, they cannot have a pleasant and smooth life with the opposite sex. This is true for most people, but especially for Scorpio-borns, who consider this world a heaven for them if they receive compliments and appreciation from their partner, and become depressed, disgusted, downcast, or broken down if their partner passes any criticism or does not approve of their actions. In spite of this, Scorpio-borns give all comforts to their partners and try to keep them in cheer and good spirits, expecting their partner to express their love and wanting demonstrations of affection.  
People born in Scorpio will enjoy their lives if their partners show a genuine affection and deep love. One is fortunate if they have a husband born in Scorpio, as they will lead a smooth life with people born in Pisces or Cancer, and agree with a husband born in Virgo or Capricorn. A Taurus husband will contribute to their happiness, as they know how to dance or adjust, so that any disharmony among themselves is not let known to anyone else. They care more for honor and family prestige. The difficulty with Scorpio-girls (only when the ascendant is afflicted) is that they work very hard, they are really true, but they suddenly lose their temper, forget themselves, and loudly retort without any consideration for the position of their husband.  
A Scorpio-woman with an afflicted ascendant once had her husband unusually consent to feed a very old poetess and philosopher when the latter made a humble request. With all humility, he very slowly and politely informed his wife. Imagine her reaction! Throughout the time she was engaged in preparing the dish, she was offering Sahasranama archana to her husband. Later, while serving the food, when he appealed to offer a little more to the old lady, she, without missing the aim, straight on his head broke the mud pot. The bottom being weak, gave way, but the mouth of the pot was strong, so she garlanded him with the ring of the mud pot.  
Another Scorpio-woman poured a cupful of boiling soup on the head of her husband when he mentioned that she forgot to use salt on that day and that the soup was flat and insipid. Therefore, it is a curse to marry a bride born in Scorpio with adverse aspects to her Lagna and Mars. One has to console themselves by saying "This is my lot; my fate". But if it receives good aspects or at least no bad aspects, one cannot get a better wife than Scorpio-borns. Similarly, Scorpio-gents will appreciate the qualities of their wives.
#### Children
Jupiter rules the second and fifth houses, while the eleventh house is governed by Mercury. Therefore, Jupiter and Mercury are the ruling planets of your children. Therefore, you will not mind having a large family and you do not support birth control, though you may preach it for others. However, you forget to practice what you preach. If Jupiter and Mercury are afflicted by the conjunction with or adverse aspect from malefics, you may not have any children at all, or you may only have one issue, mostly a daughter. Generally, Jupiter, the chief governor for children, and Mercury, the planet for plurality, being the lords of the second, fifth, and eleventh houses, will increase the number of members of the family to a good extent. The children will not only be intelligent, but also lucky.
#### Lucky Days
Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays are successful days. Sundays promise steady fortune; Mondays will keep you in good spirits and you will rejoice. They are heydays. Thursdays presage fortune. Tuesdays bless you with health and victory will be had on Tuesdays. Fridays show social success and deterioration of bank position. Wednesdays may cause anxiety through friends. Saturdays dishearten you.
For profession, meet the influential people on Sundays. Compete with others on Tuesdays (suppose you are losing popularity but yet you are in power, have the meeting to elect the President or a Secretary to the association, society or club on Tuesdays. Victory is yours especially when Chithrai star first half is transited by Moon). Transact with foreigners or make journey on Mondays. Marry on Thursdays and open account in the Bank on Thursdays. Repay loan on a Saturday, especially when Moon transits in Anuradha star and in the Ascendant you have Mandhi. Never sign any important document on Wednesdays. If you want to save money, avoid commitments on Fridays.
#### Lucky Colours
Yellow, red, orange, and cream are favourable. If you have no child or if you want sound bank position, use yellow sapphire on a pure gold ring. If you have any litigation, have ruby. Success is yours. If you want to have higher studies or to go overseas, use cream coloured pearls. For steady prosperity in your career, use light red or orange colour. Avoid blue, pure white, and green.

3, 9, 4, 1, 2 and 7 are in this order, lucky to you. Avoid 5, 6 and 8.

### Sagittarius - Dhanus
Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the Zodiac, extending from the 240th degree from the Vernal Equinox (Aries). The constellations Moolam, Poorvashada, and Uthrashada first quarter are contained in this sign.  
According to the Sayana System, the Sun enters Sagittarius around the 23rd of November and leaves it around the 22nd of December. The Sun moves daily, approximately one degree and one minute. Therefore, those born between the 23rd of November and the 22nd of December will have their horoscopes erected by the Sayana System with the Sun marked in Sagittarius.  
According to the Nirayana System, throughout Kaliyuga, the Sun will enter Sagittarius on the 15th of December and will leave it on the 14th of January every year. Therefore, those born between the 15th of December and the 14th of January will have their horoscopes erected according to the Nirayana System with the Sun marked in Sagittarius.  
Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the Zodiac, but it is the first sign governed by Jupiter. It is a fiery sign, fixed, common, positive, masculine, hot, and dry, dual-double bodied (the first half, Dhanus, is human; the second half is animal-bestial). It is of long ascension. Jupiter is the ruler of this sign. No planet gets exalted in Sagittarius, nor does any become debilitated here, but Mercury is said to have its detriment, i.e. weak, in this sign. Sun, Moon, and Mars are said to occupy their friend's house when they are in this sign, while Saturn, Venus, and Mercury are considered to be in an enemy's camp when they are in Sagittarius.  
Sagittarius is pictured as half-man with bow and arrow and half horse. "Two birds at a shot" is indicated by Dhanus. Its ruler is Jupiter, Jehovah, the Saviour. If one is suffering from any disease or meets with an accident, his life will be saved and hence it is said that Jupiter's favourable aspect means that one will enjoy "Providential Help". "If Jupiter is with you nothing can go against your interests".  
#### Physical Features
A well-proportioned and well-developed body; tall, with a large forehead, high and bushy eyebrows, a long nose, bright eyes, a charming appearance, a graceful look, a fair complexion, and a handsome figure.
#### Characteristics of Sagittarius
Sagittarius is a fiery sign, hence those born under this sign will be bold, courageous, and determined. They will be ambitious, greedy, and aspiring, and will always look on the bright side of things. They will not be timid, and will not flutter or fear and tremble even in adverse conditions. They will be dauntless and have self-confidence, and will work against odds. They are at their best only when there are obstacles. Fiery sign gives them energy, enthusiasm, vigour, and vitality.  
Being a common sign, Sagittarians will weigh the merits and demerits of each case and finally take a decision. They will be impulsive and rash, unlike Aries people who act after deep consideration. They may delay to start a work or undertake any venture, because they would have taken time to contemplate, plan, and scheme.  
Being a masculine sign, Sagittarians do not hesitate much to think, speak out, or act as they desire. They love only truth and will hold on to their principles to the last, even though they are aware that their action may bring unpleasant results. They will speak out what they feel is right, without considering how others will relish such statements.  
As the ninth sign of the Zodiac, Sagittarians will try to have higher education. They are fond of long travel and have the desire to develop friendships with foreigners. They are highly philosophical, religious-minded, and God-fearing. Jupiter, being the lord of the sign, gives them a broad mind, confidence, truth, and spiritual uplift. They will be fond of sport, and their outstanding features are justice, sympathy, and courage. They will have a quick grasp and retentive power, as the ninth and tenth houses to Sagittarius are governed by the Sun and Mercury, which are mostly found in one sign causing Nipuna yoga. Therefore, Sagittarians understand quickly and assimilate new ideas. Their intuition will be correct, and they are for justice. If they find that someone has been done injustice, they will fight and arrange for the victim to gain their rightful claims.  
Venus generally indicates what one will like most. As Venus owns the sixth house, Sagittarians will have dogs and other pet animals. As lord of the eleventh house, they will have many benefactors. They desire to be in the midst of the opposite sex and make friendships in a moment, which they maintain for a long number of years. As the Moon owns the eighth house, they will have unnecessary distrust and will change their opinion often.  
#### Characteristics to be Corrected
If the ascendant or the planet in the ascendant is afflicted, even though you are mostly good, your behaviour may occasionally be inconsiderate. You may lack tact and exaggerate or speak without truth. You may make promises that you do not keep. Do not insult or hurt others by giving your opinion, even if you are correct. Be moderate and do not develop hatred towards your parents and brothers.
#### Health
Sagittarius governs the hips, the thighs, the loins, ilium, femur, buttocks, glutinous muscles, sacral arteries, etc. Hence one may suffer from sciatica, rheumatic pain, fracture in the hip, lumbago, gout, eusonophilia, and lung trouble. Mars and Saturn in Sagittarius can cause fracture of the bones as well as ulcer in the thigh needing the surgeon's aid. Jupiter in Dhanus threatens the native with gout and pulmonary apoplexy. Jupiter in Poorvashada star causes diabetes. Saturn alone indicates contusions of the hips, T.B., chronic pulmonary disease, and asthma. The Moon indicates bronchitis, pneumonia, and diabetes. The Sun causes defective hearing and poor vision. Venus indicates tumour and diabetes. Mercury shows hiccough, asthma, etc. To Sagittarius, Mercury is a Rajyogadhipathi, owning the 10th house. It is also the Bhadhaka Sthana adhipathi, owning the 7th house, as Sagittarius is a common sign. To chara rasi, 11th house; to fixed rasi 9th house; to common sign 7th house, Mercury is a Kendhrathipathi (houses 1, 4, 7, and 10 are called Kendhra Sthanas). As houses 2 and 7 are termed as Maraka Sthanas, Mercury owning the seventh house is the strongest evil, other than Rajayoga adhipathyam, to cause fatal disease.
#### Finance and Fortune
Being a fiery sign, you do not like others ordering you, nor do you prefer to sit tight in one place and work. You desire frequent changes and fare well when given a free hand. As Jupiter rules this sign, you may be a teacher, public speaker, bank employee, or one attached to any religious institution. Politics may prove to be lucky if Jupiter is not afflicted. Mercury, being lord of 10, indicates that you may edit, publish, and have larger income through advertisement. You may be a good auditor and master Company-law. You may work in foreign embassy or in foreign affairs. Planets in any manner connected with houses 2, 6, or 10 occupying Sagittarius can offer one service in mines, transport, and engineering. Speculation may not be helpful and profitable to Sagittarians, as lord of 5 is also lord of 12. However, those who have the lords of 1, 2, 3, 6, and 11 posited in Poorvashada star may get rich quickly and have gains without pains.
#### Domestic Environments
You do not like your close relatives, but you will be generous and friendly towards the opposite sex. You will spend a lot on your children, and those without children will spend on educational institutions or the renovation of temples, etc. You will be kind to others, but not to your family. At home, you may feel a lack of independence, even though the fourth house is owned by the lord of the ascendant.
#### Finance and Benefactors
It is not difficult for you to make friends. You may have some silly quarrels with a stranger, but you will develop a permanent friendship with them. It is similar to a passenger who takes a seat in the second class of a train and fights with someone who tries to get in. Eventually, they become good friends. Sagittarians and Gemini-born people will make friends easily. The eleventh house shows friends and benefactors, while the sixth house indicates enmity and open quarrels. To Gemini-borns, Mars is the lord of the sixth and eleventh houses, and to Sagittarius-borns, Venus is the lord of the sixth and eleventh houses. You will be liked by your friends due to your sweet smile and quick wit. People born on Fridays, in Taurus and Libra, or in the nakshatras Barani, Poorvapalguni, and Poorvashada will be your long-standing friends. Those born in Hastham star may bring ill-repute to you, as the lord of the eighth house will be in the constellation of the lord of the eighth house in the tenth house.
#### Romance and Marriage
If you are a male, your wife should be wise and tactful, as your temper may flare up quickly, but only for a short time. You may be interested in games, sports, and society clubs, which may make it appear as though your family life is not important to you. Your wife should be broadminded, adjusting, and accommodative. If you marry a girl born in Sagittarius, you will be lucky. She will be calm, clever, competent, and considerate. The second, seventh, and eleventh houses indicate the partner. If Saturn, Mercury, and Venus are well-posited and not adversely aspected by Mars, they will give you a reliable, faithful, dutiful, pleasant, and intelligent wife. If Mars afflicts the lords of the second and eleventh houses, then the partner may have contact with more than one.
#### Children
Houses 2, 5 and 11 indicate the birth of children. So Saturn, Mars and Venus are the lords. Your children will not be fondled by you when they are young, but as they age, you will take much interest in them. You should not allow them to feel that you doubt their behaviour, movements, etc. If you curb their independence, they may become more obstinate and strong-willed. It will not be possible for you to correct them, so you must be very tactful in dealing with your children.
#### Lucky Days
Wednesdays and Fridays are very lucky. Thursdays promise success. Mondays cause anxiety and troubles. Tuesdays show extravagant expenses and loss. Sundays are pleasant and prosperous. Saturdays indicate slow, steady progress and assistance from others. Speculate on Fridays. If there is an election, have the polling on Fridays. For litigation, Fridays and Saturdays are successful ones. Sign contracts on Wednesdays. Avoid Mondays and Tuesdays. Make long journeys on Sundays. Write examinations on Thursdays or interview officials on Thursdays and Fridays. Do shanthi, prayer, homa, etc. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
#### Lucky Colour
White, cream, green, orange and light blue. Avoid red and pearls. Emerald bestows on you name, fame, reputation, larger yield from investment, promotion and prosperity. White cream shades show success in litigation, victory over enemies, pleasure and profit. Orange colour is auspicious for assistance from government, connections with foreigners and for long journeys. Light blue indicates increase in self-acquisition, good understanding with colleagues, support from people in authority and power. If you use ruby and red colour, it may make you more short-tempered, rash and reckless, resulting in great loss.
#### Lucky Numbers
6, 5, 3 and 8. Of these 6 and 8 are for finance, family and fortune. Avoid 2, 7 and 9.
#### Objects Indicated by Sagittarius
Moolam constellation governs medicine, physicians, flowers, roots, fruits, seeds, etc. Poorvashada shows fish, aquatic animals, aquatic fruits and flowers. Uthrashada in Sagittarius indicates horses, elephants, warriors, etc. (Brihat Samhita) arrows; spears; swords; needles, poles, sticks, canes, rope, race horses, tooth picks, crowbars, drills, chisels, ayurvedic medicinal herbs, etc.
#### Places
Hills, in a house the topmost room, places next to the oven, stables of healthy horses, receptacles for cattle, places where ammunition is stored and weapons are preserved, churches, temples, schools and colleges, courts, woods and bushes.

Australia, Arabia, Madagascar, Hungary, Sclaronia, Tuscany, Spain, Istria, Dalmatia, Italy.
#### Towns
Naples, Narbonne, Stutland, Avignon, Sheffield, Rottenberg, Cologne, Buda, Bradford, West Bromwich, Torouts, Toledo, Portland, Nottingham.

### Capricorn-Makara
Capricorn is the tenth sign of the Zodiac. It extends from 270th degree from the Vernal Equinox (Aries 0 - Mesha 0) to 300th degree. This is when the Sun has reached the southernmost point in its path (called the ecliptic) and takes the northern course from 270th degree. It is popularly known as Makara Sankranthi. When the Sun is in the 270th degree counted from the Vernal equinox, it is exactly half a day for those in the South Pole and the other half of the day is yet to run. For people in the North pole, it is exact midnight. The Nakshathras or the constellation Uthrashada second, third and fourth quarters, Sravanam, Dhanishta first and second padas are contained in this sign, Capricorn-Makara.  
According to Sayana system, the Sun, nowadays, enters Capricorn on or around 22nd December every year and leaves Capricorn on or around 21st January. The Sun moves daily approximately 18' to 11'. To those who are born between 23rd December and 21st January, any year, horoscopes cast by following Sayana system, the Sun will be shown in the sign Capricorn. But, according to Nirayana system, throughout Kaliyuga, the Sun will enter Capricorn or Makara on the 14th January and leave Nirayana Capricorn on or around 12th February every year. If the charts are erected, following stellar astrology or Nirayana system, Sun will be marked in Capricorn in the horoscopes of the persons born between 14th January and 12th February, both days inclusive.  
Capricorn-Makara is the 10th sign of the Zodiac and is the first sign governed by Saturn. The other sign which Saturn owns is called Aquarius and is next to Capricorn. Capricorn is a chara-movable-cardinal, solstitial, tropical, negative, feminine, earthy, dry, cold, quadrupedal, persevering, despondent sign of short-ascension in the southern-hemisphere. Saturn gets debilitated in the sign (owned by Mars) Aries-Mesha, but Mars gets exalted in the sign (owned by Saturn) in Capricorn-Makara. Jupiter gets debilitated in this sign. Whenever Capricorn is occupied by both the luminaries Sun and Moon, they are said to be in enemy's camp. But Venus and Mercury are considered to occupy the friend's residence when they are in Capricorn.  
Capricorn is the sign of sacrifice. It is said that at the time of the birth of Jesus, the Sun had just entered Capricorn which is the symbol of resurrection. Even today, in India, the goat is the sacrificial animal. Whosoever that sacrifices himself is a Capricornian. The popular saying, "He was the goat" is applicable to one born in Makara.  
#### Physical Features of Capricorn
Saturn, the lord of the sign, shows that one will be emaciated, weak, and grow slowly. The body will not be muscular or plump, but slender. One grows tall suddenly after 16 years of age, and as one advances in age, their constitution also improves. The face will be thin and oval, with a long nose and deep-set eyes. The hair will be coarse, and if Saturn is weak, there will not be sufficient growth of hair in the forehead. However, if Saturn is well-posited, there will be profuse growth. Saturn rules this sign and governs the osseous system in the body. If Saturn is ill-posited for those born in Capricorn, one may suffer from T.B. of the bones or mottled enamel or fluorine intoxication. As age advances, the person may become hunch-backed, and there may be a scar in the knee-cap or at least a mole.
#### Characteristics of Capricorn
Capricorn is an earthy sign, so the person will be economical, prudent, reasonable, thoughtful, methodical, and practical-minded. It confers a plodding, persevering, and patiently working temperament. The person will be calculative and business-like.  
Capricorn is a movable sign, so one will quickly execute any work after taking a decision carefully. They will have the push and confidence to make a thorough change in their career if it is found to be advantageous. They will have a special organizing capacity and with enormous tolerance, patience, and a steady nature, they will be at the head of certain projects, however large they may be.  
Being a feminine sign owned by Saturn, it gives one a reserved nature and fear of ridicule. They will not entertain any hope on others' promises, nor will they be optimistic until they come out successful or realize their ambition. It is not easy to cheat Capricornians.  
Further, the person will appear to be modest and polite. They will not make friendships quickly, but will take a long time to test an individual before making a permanent tie of friendship.  
Saturn, who owns this house, indicates that one will be either honest, sincere, and reliable or the most conceited, dishonest, selfish, greedy, and miserly, never hesitating to commit any crime. Purposeful Saturn shows that Capricornians will never spend their time in idle talk. Lethargic Saturn suggests that the person needs another person to kindle them to do a task. Normally, they will not take action then and there, but postpone it to the last moment. At the instance of another, they will start doing the job, and once they take it up, they will be at it until it is finished. Delaying Saturn may not confer success on them immediately, but like Robert Bruce, they will make repeated attempts and will finally come out successful. If they are given encouragement, they will complete the work with enthusiasm. Obstacles and hindrances will depress them for some time, but they will not leave it.  
People who dive in the sea and mine excavators are governed by Saturn or Capricorn. Till they find the spring, they will be digging the well. Further, it shows that one will utilize everything to a material purpose.  
Generally, Venus presages those which one will desire to have. As it owns the houses 5 and 10, and since Saturn owns the sign Capricorn, they will try to have pleasurable pursuits, will be fond of music, drama, cinema, etc., will speculate, will have a proper Guru (Preceptor) to initiate them a 'Mantra', and will be fortunate to have success.  
Moon owns the seventh house, so one will be always having a company. Otherwise, there will be depression. Whenever they work, study, or travel, they will have the company of a friend to keep themselves cheerful and active.  
This sign also produces many great men, especially in politics. Saturn in the tenth house will be exalted. In certain sub in Libra, Saturn gains such an influence that Capricorns having Saturn in such positions will think something, speak something, and do something else. They will be highly tactful, diplomatic, clever, cunning, and selfish and will not be grateful to any. While Mercury gives the native the power to remember one and all before election and totally forget immediately after selection, a good aspect between Saturn and Mercury in the horoscope of such persons is a fortune to the country as they will work for others. They will not have any favoritism and will abide by the moral law. The disadvantage is that they will be slow and steady in their ventures, but with the blessing of the Providence, they will ultimately have grand success.  
#### Characteristics to be Corrected
If either the ascendant in Capricorn or the lord of the ascendant, Saturn, receives bad aspects from any other planet, the native will likely be selfish and egoistic, rarely optimistic and mostly pessimistic, desperate and broken-hearted, and prone to overworking and exerting too much. Due to overstrain, they will feel fatigued.  
Hence, the native should strive to correct themselves after understanding that they may not be aware of their faults or defects and that one born in Capricorn will have the above undesirable characteristics. They should develop dignity and diplomacy, avoid nervousness and discontent.
#### Health
Capricorn governs the knees and the patella bones, and Saturn signifies the complete bony structure. Capricorn also governs the dry epidermis, so injuries to the part of the body near the knee cap, such as urticaria, skin diseases, eczema, bruises, and dislocations, are indicated when the lord of the sixth house occupies Capricorn and when malefics are in the ascendant in Capricorn. Saturn in Uthrashada threatens murmur of the heart, while Mars in Uthrashada shows cardiac thrombosis. Rahu and Kethu in Uthrashada cause blood pressure, and Uranus causes heart failure. Planets in Sravanam star show affection of the lungs, eczema, etc., while planets in Dhanishta threaten high fever, bronchitis, pneumonia, urticaria, bruises, fractures, and dislocations.
Hysteria, rheumatism, and cold are indicated by the owner of this sign, Saturn. As people born in this sign will be depressed and discontented, worried and gloomy, gradually the digestive system will become weak and it may cause flatulence. Capricorn opposing Cancer may cause pulmonary affection and in 6 to Leo may cause trouble to the heart. In a large number of horoscopes, it was found that evil planets in Capricorn affect the heart of the native during the period of the malefic occupying Capricorn.
It is advantageous to be in the midst of cheerful youngsters, take heating and stimulating food, include laxatives, have regular physical exercise, never jump and fall down, and avoid high jump and pole jump. The second and seventh houses are Maraka Sthanas, and even though Saturn is the lord of the ascendant, as he is, by nature, the chief governor for longevity and as he also owns the second house, Aquarius, the Maraka-Sthana, Saturn will end one's life. The seventh house is owned by Moon, so Mars, Saturn, and Moon are evil and they will cause death. Sun, who owns Leo, the eighth house, does not become evil due to its lordship Jataka-chandrika. By that, one is to understand that unless Sun gains evil results by conjoining with or being aspected by Saturn, Mars, and Moon, it will not cause death.
Mercury, lord of the sixth house, will affect health. Hence Vitamin B deficiency, gas trouble, and general nervous debility may be expected during the periods and sub-periods of Mercury. One is to understand clearly that Saturn, Mars, and Moon will cause danger and anxiety to one's longevity in their conjoined sub-periods in the major period of the evil planet, while Mercury will repeatedly give, more or less, the same diseases.
#### Finance and Fortune
Capricorn-borns are conservative and will never mind difficulties, handicaps, and hindrances; they will continue to work in the same direction until they come out successful. Their ambition drives them to persevere and they have the desire to gain name, fame, reputation, and money. They will try to avail of all opportunities arising and consolidate all their affairs and resources. As a business person born in any of the 12 signs during Jupiter dasa, they will be going on expanding their business and opening many branches in different parts. However, during Saturn dasa and during the dasa of planets in Capricorn, they will consolidate and concentrate. They are pessimistic by nature and do not speculate; they will invest in permanent possessions after carefully scrutinizing the documents and obtaining enough security. They are industrious and save money slowly and steadily. As long as they do not speculate, take chances, and risks, they cannot expect a windfall. They do not waste money and if they serve others, they will prove to be most economical, correct, trustworthy, well-informed, and wide-awake workers. They are best fitted to serve in the Finance Department and will always think of the future and save satisfactorily for the ‘rainy day’ or to meet unexpected and uncommon expenses.
Saturn being the lord of Capricorn and also the second house, the native may deal in or serve in such things as are mentioned below. Further, good aspects from planets to the ascendant or to the lord of the ascendant, Saturn, indicate the following professions. Sun forming good aspect indicates service in quasi-government, municipality, local boards, Corporation, or Government, dealing in mine ores, or organizing and managing big institutions. The native will invest money in wholesale business or invest in lands, buildings, etc., which may be let out for rent for Government use. Moon forming good aspect shows that the person will deal with kerosene, lands, and animals and will be a successful agriculturist. They may excavate wells, build tanks, or may be a contractor to reinforce the bund of lakes, etc. Mars forming favorable aspect is necessary for engravers of metal, masons, engineers, surveyors, cement manufacturers (Venus also must form aspect for cement and leather manufacture), surgeons (Sun too), lawyers (Jupiter also), brick-kiln owners, etc. Mercury forming good aspect produces engineers, detective novel writers, deep thinkers, teachers (Mathematics, Physics), dealers in scientific instruments, and gives chances to work in C.I.D. department (Mars also). It produces experts in handprint, forgery; it is advantageous to those who practice concentration, crystal-gazing yoga, etc. Jupiter forming good aspect shows that one may be a physician or a scientist. One may gain through clubs and societies, manage large companies, or serve Religious Endowment Board. They may take contracts on a long-term basis. Venus forming good aspect makes one patient and honest, steady and sincere. They may deal in chemical, mine ores, leather and hides, or may serve in slaughter house, birth control; may be a sanyasi without any attraction to the opposite sex. They may invest their money on gardens and lands. The people working in the cremation or burial ground will also have this aspect. [Purohits, having good aspect between Jupiter and Venus are experts in conducting a marriage whereas Purohits having good aspect between Saturn and Venus are conversant with disposals]. Uranus forming good aspect gives good knowledge in occult sciences; the person is an expert in mental healing or healing without any drug. They may serve in the Railway; they may practice astrology or study Geology; they will be interested in collecting curios, in preserving monuments, etc. (Venus also). Neptune forming good aspect shows success in secret service, submarine liquids, oils, sub-soil materials, etc. They should not overtrade; then they will be successful. Long journeys on land or sea will prove to be advantageous.
#### Domestic Environments
Generally, Capricorn-borns are not very eager to get married early. But they do marry, because they feel they have to and are destined to. They do not want many children, yet they often become the parents of a large family. They never fail to do their duty and they do love their wives and children, but they do not display their love, so the children may mistake their Capricorn parents for treating them coldly.
They collect things which are beautiful and will try to have a library of their own. They hate noise but want a quiet atmosphere and privacy. They prefer seclusion and peace, which can lead their family members to mistakenly believe they are cold.
Even if the wife (or husband) is argumentative and quarrelsome, he (or she) will mostly be absent from the scene and avoid retorting; the fire of anger will have its own natural death. This is because they care for the prestige and honour of a family life, even if their partner is bent on doing harm.
#### Friends and Benefactors: Normally, the native does not take anyone into his confidence, but he will be known to many and have a large number of acquaintances. Good friends will be few only. He will be true to his friends and respect them throughout life. As he can keep others cheerful with his witty conversation, he is best suited to be an active member of societies and clubs. He will find that those born on Tuesdays in the sign Scorpio or in the three stars Mrigasirisha, Chithra and Dhanishta are his benefactors. They will never hesitate to lend him assistance; in fact, he will realise that they help him even without his asking for it. He will also find that people born in Bharani, Poorvapalguni and Poorvashada stars are very helpful to him.
As the lord of 11 also owns the 4th house, he may receive benefits through his mother. Co-tenants will co-operate. The author strongly advises Capricornians to take buildings on a rental basis and sublet a portion of it for the total rental value. Thus, they can live in the same premises without paying any rent.
#### Romance and Marriage: Even though the native may have affection, he will never give expression to it nor will he be fit for romance, dance, etc. He will not be emotional. He will be very slow and cautious when he approaches the other sex. He will not be bold or rash; never will he take the lead. He will ask the other very tactfully, obtain her consent once, twice and even thrice and even then, he will be afraid to proceed further. The other sex will be worried by the hesitancy of the man born in Capricorn.
Anyhow, it is true that he will take a long time to choose his partner. Houses 2, 7 and 11 indicate marriage. The lords of the signs are Saturn, Moon and Mars. Find out which is the strongest in your horoscope. The features, the characteristics, etc., will be governed by the strongest of the three.
If the lord of 2, Saturn, is strong and well-posited, the marriage will take place during Saturn's sub-period. The partner will be selfish but will be very economical. She will not permit the native to spend money; she will observe the tradition and custom of the family and she will be industrious.
If Moon, the lord of 7, is very strong, the partner will be timid and poor in health. She will desire to have frequent changes of residence. She will be unsteady; yet, she will be much attached to the native and to the other members of the family. She will be sympathetic, patient, devoted and adaptable. She will need assistance from her husband and will prove to be most accommodating.
If Mars, the lord of 11, is the strongest of the three planets, the partner will be modern and masculine. She will prove to be an able and faithful wife; she will manage the whole family. She will be a hard worker, an excellent cook and an extravagant hostess. She will not give freedom to the person born in Capricorn. She will direct everything and maintain strict discipline. Marriage is generally fixed and celebrated suddenly at a very early age.
#### Children
Even though one may have many children, he should not fondle with them. He should do his duty and not mix with them or join in their play or allow them to make noise. He should want them to be quiet and attend to their work, and not allow his children to go beyond a limit. He should keep them under control, but at the same time not antagonize them. As years pass on, the children will understand that inwardly their father has strong affection for them, though he does not give expression to it, because the children will realize that their father considers their welfare as the first priority in his life and will work hard for their comforts and conveniences.
#### Lucky Days
Fridays, Tuesdays, and Saturdays are the best. Wednesdays are successful. Thursdays and Sundays show expenses. Mondays end in enmity or litigation. Speculate on Tuesdays and Fridays. Invest on Saturdays and sign documents on Tuesdays. Compete on Wednesdays and go on long journeys on Wednesdays. Avoid Mondays and Sundays. Pray to God or Goddess on Fridays or Tuesdays.
#### Lucky Colours
White, red, and blue are lucky colours. Avoid yellow and cream colours. White (diamond) gives lucky and beautiful children, speculative gains, success in music, cinema, drama, etc., success in pleasurable pursuits, politics, and profession. In business, one will have unexpected advantages, improvement, and assistance from government officials, etc. Red colour gives the native building, land, property, vehicle, and good friends. Blue colour is auspicious for health, long life, financial success, and a happy family life.

### Aquarius
Aquarius is the eleventh sign of the zodiac and extends from 30° of the vernal equinox (Aries 0° - Mesha 0°) to 30°. The sun is in its northern course during this time. The asterisms, Dhanishta later half, Sathabhisha, and Poorvapathra's first two and third padas (quarters) are contained in this sign. According to the Sayana system, the sun enters Aquarius on or around 21st January and leaves Aquarius on or around 19th February, moving daily approximately 1° 0' 54" to 1° 0' 16". In horoscopes erected according to the Sayana system, the sun will be shown in the sign Aquarius for people born during this time of the year. However, according to the Nirayana system, the sun will enter Aquarius on 13th February and leave it on 12th March each year. If the charts are erected for people born on any of the dates in this time of any year, the sun will be shown in Aquarius.  
Saturn owns two houses, Capricorn and Aquarius, and is the second sign governed by Saturn. Before the discovery of Uranus (Herschel), both the Hindu sages and the Western astrologers allotted this house to Saturn. After the discovery of Herschel, the Western savants allotted Aquarius to Uranus. No planet enjoys exaltation in this sign, nor does any planet suffer debilitation. However, this sign is a friendly one to Mercury and Venus, whereas it is said to be the enemy's camp for the other four planets: Sun, Moon, Mars, and Jupiter. Saturn is strong in this sign and the qualities ascribed to this sign agree with those of Uranus.  
Aquarius is symbolized by water pouring out from a vessel. The Hebrews called Aquarius "Delphi" meaning "water container". Aquarius is an airy sign with high humidity and represents mostly the rain from the air, as the air enveloping the earth evaporates the water on the earth, holds it in air, forms clouds, and pours as rain. In the human system, Aquarius is the distributor of water and gas, helping recovery from the sinking life and rejuvination with satisfactory strength, just like the perishing planets (e.g. grass) again regain life and we are delighted. Aquarius is called an airy, fixed, sthira, moist, positive, human, and voice sign. It is of short ascension.  
#### Physical Features
Though Aquarius is a sign of short ascension, people born under it are usually tall with a full stature. They are strong. Their faces are oval, their complexion fair, and their appearance is handsome. Of the twelve signs, Venus and Aquarius produce the most beautiful children. Their teeth may be defective, and their hair has a brown shade. There may also be a mole or scar on the calf muscle.
#### Characteristics of Aquarius
Aquarius is an airy sign, so Aquarians are usually intelligent and cannot be fooled by flattery. They can read the character of others and can detect the motives of others. Saturn, which rules the airy sign, shows that Aquarians consider the merits and demerits of every case slowly and carefully, so that they can observe what others do, watch and see the results, and then act. Though they are intelligent, they can be slow in grasping and absorbing new ideas, but they have a good retentive power and never forget.  
Being the eleventh sign of the zodiac, Aquarians have a broad outlook and human understanding, are outspoken, unselfish, humane, and impersonal. They are social, but they select their friends carefully and are silent workers in any society or club. They always make efforts to bring about harmony and to change any condition which is undesirable, unhealthy, or detrimental to further progress.  
Uranus, the other ruler of the sign, shows that Aquarians are shrewd, clear-headed, quick-witted, and wide-awake. They also have a desire to improve and raise the mental standard of all. They are often far ahead in fresh ideas, new thoughts, new approaches to problems, improved designs for living, etc. They have their own way of thinking and use their own discretion. They are not afraid to do anything unusual or irregular if they consider it to be morally right. Even in dress, they have their own individuality, mannerisms, peculiarities, and specialties.  
Aquarians have intuition and an inclination towards science. Being a fixed sign, they are very constant in their friendships and are usually persistent in all their undertakings, eventually succeeding. They are best suited for research work and are very strong in their likes and dislikes. They will go to great lengths to help their good friends, but cannot be pressured into doing something they do not agree with. They are stubborn, but not foolhardy.  
This house is the House of 'Kama', which generally means pleasure and pleasant union. However, the real meaning of 'Kama' is 'desire'. In the four Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha Purusharthas, Aquarius denotes 'Kama'. Leo-Simha, the fifth sign of the zodiac, has to show pleasurable pursuits for worldly life (Ikha-Loka-Sukha). But Para Loka Sadhana, being opposite to worldly pleasures, the kama sign for Para Loka Sadhana is Aquarius, which opposes the Ikha Loka Sukha pleasure sign, Leo-Simha. Aquarians have a desire to leave physical subject and develop intuition and inspiration. They prefer secluded deep meditation and good concentration, and may become ascetics at some point in their lives. They do not preach to others, but practice what they preach.  
Jupiter, the fortunate planet, owning the houses 2 and 11, generally blesses the native with a good family and satisfactory bank position. Mars, ruling the 3rd and 10th houses, gives the inclination to study, do research, be bold and courageous, and eventually attain name, fame, and reputation through ultimate success. Venus, ruling the houses 4 and 9, shows attachment to both parents, higher education, and research overseas. They will enjoy the fruits of life in this world. As Jupiter rules 2 and 11 and Venus governs 4 and 9, and because Poorvashada is governed by Venus in Jupiter's sign, people born in Aquarius are usually fortunate during the period of the planet occupying Poorvashada indicated by the occupant.  
Mercury ruling the 8th house and Moon the 6th house show that Aquarians have always food for thought and are often contemplating, planning, and scheming. If they are afflicted, they have a tendency to become melancholy and reclusive, and are strong pessimists.  
#### Characteristics to be Corrected
If either the ascendant or Saturn, the lord of ascendant, is afflicted by the adverse aspect from any planet, then:  
(a) The native will be lazy and lethargic, so they should cultivate activity and promptness;  
(b) They should avoid solitude;  
(c) They should not be worried and gloomy;  
(d) They should not be a pessimist;  
(e) They should not be pushy and alert;  
(f) They should not be very rigid towards those whom they dislike.  
#### Health
As Aquarius opposes the sign of the Sun, Aquarians are susceptible to infectious diseases. If one feels fatigue on little exertion, one should consult an intelligent and capable physician. Tooth trouble and tonsils may cause troubles, as Saturn is a cold planet and Aquarius is an airy sign, they will not have satisfactory circulation and cannot withstand cold weather. They should warm up their limbs and feet and attend immediately after any injury or abrasion. They should avoid living in malaria-infected areas and not overtax themselves. One should take rest when necessary. As Aquarius is the 11th sign of the zodiac, one's ankle or limb may be affected. One should guard against varicose veins and heart trouble, which may be rheumatic or cause high blood pressure. The legs may swell and Venus, if afflicted, can cause skin diseases, eczema, etc. One may also suffer from eye trouble, dropsy, and poor digestion due to sedentary life, constipation, and insomnia. Planets in Dhanishta threaten high fever, malaria, filaria, elephantiasis, and fractures, while planets in Sathabhisha and Poorvapathrapada can cause dropsy, irregularity of the circulatory system, elephantiasis, eczema, skin trouble due to poor circulation of the blood, ulcerated gums, and mottled enamel. Libra is the 9th sign to Aquarius, and Venus rules the 9th house. As Venus is a benefic by nature, it is considered to be evil as it affects one's longevity. Jupiter and Sun are the owners of the 2nd and 6th houses respectively, and Moon, as lord of the 6th house, causes disease during its period. The common ailment for Aquarians is indicated by Moon. Jupiter, Sun, Mercury (as lord of the 8th house), and Venus in their conjoined period or sub period can be fatal. According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, planets in Uthrapalguni, Visaka, and Poorvashada will affect the health of the native.
#### Finance and Fortune
Generally, Aquarians make money through modern machinery, inventions, and discoveries. They do not believe in earning money immediately for the work done. Instead, they may remain for a long period, patiently working and after finding out some developments and novel ones, they will make money by using their talent. They do not seek honor, but money, which they consider is needed for worldly life. They are neither economical nor liberal nor extravagant; they have the talent and ambition. They are both fortunate and unfortunate.  
Jupiter, which governs the second house, indicates that one can be a scientist, work in the administrative department of a large industry, or be the director of a public limited company, a lecturer, a metaphysician, psychologist, or astrologer, or work in legal, finance, education, or religious endowment boards. One may be a contractor of mine ores or deal in shipping and export.  
Moon, lord of the sixth house, indicates that one may practice medicine, do social service, shipping, be a sailor, submarine, pumpsets dealer, kerosene dealer, export and import businessman, or deal in any liquid.  
Mars, the lord of the tenth house, shows that one may deal in metals, insurance, chemicals, mechanical engineering, building construction, mine ores, be a brick kiln owner, boiler manufacturer, cement dealer, surveyor, surgeon who does post-mortem, murderer, butcher, barber, dealer in lead, copper, and steel, or be a C.I.D. officer.  
Mercury, forming a good aspect with the cusps of the second, sixth, or tenth house, produces booksellers, printers, accountants, registrars, interpreters, postmen, experts in handwriting and thumb-impression, C.I.D. inspectors, astronomers, astrologers, etc.  
Venus, forming a good aspect with the cusps of the second, sixth, or tenth house, shows that one may be a poet or painter or musician, deal in hats, shoes, purses, handbags, or chowries, be a barber or dealer in blades, deal in medicines for the cure of eczema, skin disease, or birth control, and sell goods for contraceptive practice. Very old stuff, especially wine, will be dealt with if Venus occupies the meridian. One will prosper as a social worker or an interior decorative artist.  
Uranus, forming a harmonious aspect with the cusps of the second, sixth, or tenth house or planets in these houses, indicates that one may be a research scholar or work in research institutes, or railways, public service, be a mechanic, technician in the electricity department, wireless stations, or electronics, a salesman, traveller, astrologer, engineer, or dealer in electrical goods.  
Neptune shows that one may work in a submarine, mine, secret service, intelligence department, be a fifth columnist, seaman, captain of a ship, salt dealer, etc.  
#### Domestic Environments
As Aquarians are very social, they keep their home clean and tidy so that they can entertain friends frequently. The home is usually well-furnished, often with a collection of antiques arranged in a modern fashion. Aquarians never hesitate to purchase ultra-modern electric appliances for the convenience of those at home. They take pleasure in possessing them, and even more pleasure in demonstrating them to visitors. They give up traditional and old cumbersome, troublesome methods, and instead adopt modern ones to save time and trouble. Aquarians are unique in that they prefer both solitude and company. They are also dutiful to their relatives, neither overly attached nor detached.  
#### Friends and Benefactors
Aquarius is the 11th sign of the Zodiac, and the 11th house to Aquarius is governed by Jupiter. Hence, Aquarians are always lively with good humour, high spirits, and cheer. They want many friends, and Jupiter gives them reliable, true, sincere, and good friends. With some of them, Aquarians may be somewhat reserved, which may lead these friends to think that Aquarians are unapproachable and cold. However, Aquarians do not find fault with others; they take everything in stride, even when they are not treated properly. Aquarians are good partners in business and harmonious husbands, contributing to a happy life. They have a great desire to study the character and behaviour of their friends. They are very true to their friends, even if a few of them may be selfish or cheats. They realise that too much intimacy will lead to contempt, so they are mostly quiet and unassuming, which helps them to gain a large number of friends and make home life pleasant.  
#### Romance and Marriage
As Aquarians are intelligent, they always prefer an educated and equally intelligent partner. As they have strong attachment and also a permanent one, and as they are unassuming, they do not have control over the partner. They move with all very freely, but they prefer those who are equally social, shrewd, and studious. Slowly and without assigning any reason, they will discontinue the friendship and love with one if the person does not meet the standards they expect. They do not give expression to their love. If the lovers are passionate, they will not be satisfied, as Aquarians may appear to be cold. This is a misunderstanding; Aquarians are not cold. Houses 2, 7, and 11 indicate a partner in life, and so the partners will be governed by Jupiter or the Sun. Therefore, the partners will be law-abiding, true, honest, and sincere. They are magnanimous and noble, and dutiful. Those marrying Aquarians will find that they are very human, kind, sympathetic, and accommodating. They are generous and gracious, and care for harmony and happiness. Aquarian wives are unconventional. If they find that the partners are not meeting their desired standards, they will not hesitate to satisfy themselves by changing partners. But, if the partner can satisfy them, they will cooperate most willingly with the husband, share their responsibilities, duties, and work, and even assist the husband in his work. Hence, Gemini and Libra-borns are best suited to Aquarians. The partners should know that the drawback of Aquarians in marriage is their impersonality. They may appear to lack interest to such wives who are selfish and who expect the husband to pay all attention to them and spend all the time with them. This is impossible for intelligent people who are always thinking and researching science, etc.  
#### Children
Aquarians do not act as if they are aged; they should be respected and behave like a strict teacher. As a result, children not only have the greatest affection for them, but also pay more respect to their parents. Aquarians train their children in intelligent and novel methods which contribute to their courage and confidence. They also narrate stories to their children to help them cope with childish ways, and encourage them to give their ideas and pursue their hobbies. Aquarians judge their children, telling them what is good and what is bad, and help them become versatile, active, and clever.
Houses 2, 5, and 11 denote children, and Jupiter and Mercury are the significators. This suggests that they will be journalists, information officers, mathematicians, propagandists, etc.
#### Lucky Days
Thursdays, Fridays, Tuesdays, and Mondays are the most fortunate days. Wednesdays and Sundays are unfortunate days, and Saturdays offer mixed results, mostly loss. It is best to speculate on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and compete with anyone on Tuesdays and Mondays. Fridays are best for entering a college or going overseas. Saturdays should be avoided for purchases and investments, and Wednesdays and Sundays should never be speculated on.
#### Lucky Colour
Yellow, red, white, and cream are lucky colours. Yellow indicates an increase in income, a satisfactory bank position, and a happy family life. Red indicates victory over enemies, reputation, and success. White indicates good domestic environments, pleasure, and success in education and dealing with foreigners. Cream indicates an overdraft facility, winning an election, and victory over enemies. Orange should be avoided, as it threatens opposition, and green should be avoided, as it indicates loss in litigation, trouble, and danger. Blue should also be avoided, as it indicates unexpected loss, treachery, etc.
#### Lucky Numbers
3, 12, 21, 30, 48, 57, and so on; 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54; 2, 11, 20, 38, 47, 56; 7, 16, 25, 34, 43, 52. Numbers to be avoided are 1, 10, 28, 37, 46, and 55; 4, 13, 22, 31, 40, and 58; 5, 14, 23, 32, 41, and 50; 8, 17, 26, 35, 44, and 53.
#### Persons and Objects Indicated by Aquarius
Dhanista constellation in Aquarius indicates devotees of Venkateswara, the defence department, industry, wholesale business, dealers in metals, surgeons, automobile, charitable, rich, and social persons. Sathabhisha constellation indicates wool, fleece, silk, hessian, electric appliances, dynamos, railways, buses, aquatic products, dealers in fish, hunters, washermen, distillers, snares, fowlers, etc. Poorvapathrapada constellation indicates ferries, bridges, hydroelectric power, robbers, cowherds, murderers, low-class people, irreligious, unconventional people, and able lawyers, as well as birth and death registrars and lecturers.
#### Places Indicated by Aquarius
Hilly and uneven places where streams flow, places near springs, caves, and the edge of roofs, quarries, mines of ores, any place recently excavated, trenches, tunnels, windows, places where radio sets, transistors, television sets, tape recorders, and telephones are kept, ladders, and stairways, etc.

### Pisces - Meena
Pisces is the twelfth sign of the zodiac, the last sign of the zodiac. It is also 36 degrees in longitude. It extends from 330 degrees from the Vernal Equinox (the point of intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic where the zodiac commences - which is AMG to 360 degrees and this sign is at the end of the zodiac. The 30th degree of Pisces and the zero degree of Aries are one and the same point. As the Sun moves north, while passing through this sign, it comes nearer and nearer to the celestial equator and is exactly on the celestial equator when the Sun is in 30 Pisces.  
The constellations contained in the sign are Poorvapathra pada fourth quarter, Uthrapathrapada, and Revathi. According to the Sayana system, the Sun, nowadays, enters Pisces on or around 19th February and passes on to Aries on or around 21st March. The Sun moves by one degree and a half minute in the first week, mostly one degree until 7th March, and then it moves a little less than a degree a day. In the horoscopes erected according to the Sayana system, for people born in any of these dates, the Sun will be shown in Pisces. However, the Nirayana zodiac being a fixed one throughout this yuga, the Sun will enter Pisces-Meena on 12th March and leave this sign on 13th April any year. All the 21/4 stars in this sign will be passed by the Sun in this period. For people born during this time of year, the Sun will be shown in Pisces.  
Pisces is governed by Jupiter. Before the discovery of the planet Neptune, Westerners also allotted this sign to Jupiter. Now, they have given it to Neptune, as the qualities of this sign and those of Neptune mostly agree. In this sign, Venus is exalted, Mercury is debilitated, and Saturn does not lose strength but becomes auspicious.  
It is said by the Hindus that Venus and Jupiter are enemies. By that, they mean that the qualities of Jupiterians and Venusians will be different; their thoughts, their actions, their mode of life, their company, and society will never agree. We should not literally take that Jupiter and Venus are enemies. Jupiterians are inclined towards spiritual life whereas Venusians are out to satisfy their animal instincts and will try to enjoy all the fruits of life in this world.  
This sign is said to be a friendly one to the Sun, Moon, and Mars. To me, it appears that Moon alone can have full advantage in this sign and Mars as well as the Sun cannot be so strong in offering the results of the houses they own. Why? Pisces is the ninth sign to Cancer owned by the Moon. So, the Moon will form a trine aspect to its sign. But Mars will be weak in bestowing the results denoted by Aries, as it will be in the twelfth house to Aries, and the Sun loses strength to offer the matters signified by Leo, as the owner will be in the eighth house to its own house.  
Neptune, the God of the Ocean, will be strong in this sign. As Pisces is the twelfth sign of the zodiac and since the twelfth house denotes sea voyage and life in a foreign land, it is appropriate to allot this house to Neptune.  
Pisces is symbolized with two fishes. One will lead towards the north and the other towards the south and it is parallel to the ecliptic. This is called the sign of Moksha, Heaven, obtained by doing Dharma, i.e., one's duty, charity, etc. It is said that Jesus fed with five loaves and two fishes. This sign is a symbol of compassion also.  
Pisces is a watery, cold, common, Ubaya, feminine, fruitful, psychic, emotional, bicorporal double-legged sign on the Southern hemisphere and is of short ascension.  
#### Physical Features
Pisces generally produces short people. They will weigh as much as a tall person as they will be plump and the hands and feet will appear to be short and stout. The shoulders are muscular and spherical. The eyes will be big and protruding. But the hair will be soft and silky.  
#### Characteristics
Pisces is a watery sign ruled by Jupiter, the chief governor for philosophy and progeny. Hence, the person will be philosophical, restless, ever dreamy, contemplating, imagining, and never hesitating to lead a romantic life. He will be honest, outspoken, helpful, and humane. He will not go into the cause of other's troubles, but he will lead his assistance at moment's call. Just like water which can put out the fire (no doubt depending on the proportion also), the person born in Pisces will calm down the enemies, treat them courteously, and forgive them. He will be unassuming and due to over-liberality and unbounded generosity, he cannot progress much. They hamper his advancement. He is a staunch "Ahimsa" observer. He cannot think of doing harm to any; not that he is incapable; but he is so good a person depositing, in his bank, more of his meritorious deeds than the money which he can save by being economical. As it is a dual sign, he is a puzzle to others and to himself. One can find contradictions in his nature. He cannot be steady. He is mostly sweet-tempered and socially inclined.  
Being a feminine sign, he can be led away by fresh ideas and fancies. He will be polite and modest. Venus, exalted herein, makes him a poet, a musician, or a painter, or he can serve in a make-up room as he is a harmless person. So also, in worldly affairs, he can clearly understand the defects, difficulties, and deficiency and plan in various ways to alleviate the sufferings of the people. He is best fitted to be in the Planning Commission.  
Being a common and feminine sign, the expression of his thoughts will be modified and even thoroughly changed depending upon the audience. Pisces type of character is really difficult to cope with.  
Being the twelfth sign of the zodiac, he will have the desire to study the occult science, the divine life. He is timid and has no self-confidence. He will have the wish to go overseas and will be visiting foreign lands. Mars, the lord of the second house, makes him extravagant. He earns more and spends much more money. He will be frank and fearless. Venus as lord of the third house gives him good neighbours and he develops his friendship by his generosity and great service to them. Mercury indicates that he will be studious and be ever changing his residence. The Moon makes him more timid, dreamy, and imaginative. The Sun shows that he has to necessarily take all precautionary measures whenever there is an epidemic and he will be a nervous type of person.  
The one defect in Pisces is that they will rely upon all their friends and late in life they will realize that the world has produced both good and wicked people and he is also not an exception to fall a victim in the hands of the so-called Saturn and friends. Wisdom comes late.  
#### Characteristics to be Corrected
(a) Do not worry, as you are prone to changing moods.  
(b) Do not underestimate yourself.  
(c) Cultivate ambition.  
(d) Be generous, but not overly generous.  
(e) Do not rely on other people's promises.  
(f) Do not spend too much time daydreaming.  
#### Health
Being a watery sign, those born under Pisces will be prone to drinking and, as this sign is opposite to Virgo, they may develop gastric troubles. As the 12th house denotes the ankles and feet, they may suffer from affections of the ankles and feet, such as varicose veins or guinea worm.  
Sun in Pisces: Those born under this sign may experience perspiration of the feet, chillness, intestinal troubles due to lack of blood supply, and typhoid.  
Moon: Drinking and over-drugging the system.  
Mars: Fractures in the foot, deformities, corns, plies, inflammation in the bowels, and hernia.  
Mercury: Generous nervous debility, deafness, a tendency towards tuberculosis, and cramps.  
Jupiter: Swollen feet, perspiring, an enlarged liver, tumours in the abdomen and intestines, being overworked, deficiency of enzymes, and tumours in the abdominal region.  
Venus: Gout, intestinal tumours.  
Saturn: Rheumatism, foot-drop, tuberculosis, dropsy, and ben-ben.  
Planets in Poorvapadrapada constellation may cause abdominal tumours, an enlarged liver, and enzyme deficiency. Planets in Revathi star may cause deafness, general nervous debility, and cramps.  
#### Finance and Fortune
Pisceans are particularly happy when their vocation includes work that requires a broad vision and scope for good action. Their main mode of life and desire is to be of help to others who need either health or wealth knowledge. Therefore, they are good nurses, caterers, welfare workers, teachers, accountants, and bankers.
Since the fifth house - the house of pleasurable pursuits - is ruled by the Moon, who by nature gives such a hobby or desire according to the house it owns, one will be interested in music, opera, cinema, etc., and also occult science. The exaltation of Venus produces musicians, poets, actors, etc. They cannot concentrate and do any detailed work, but if any arduous task is to be done, they are methodical, persevering, industrious, true, sincere, and honest.  
They have good business ability and thrive better as a liaison officer than as a managing director or chairman. Jupiter owning both the ascendant and the tenth house shows that they can succeed as ministers and physicians. The best business or service suited to them will be sailor in the navy, captain of a ship, shipping and clearing agents in the harbour, port trust, custom house, dealers in drinks, oils, beverages, chemicals, motion pictures (since it is a mute sign), costumes, cosmetics, service in temples, churches, mutts, aquariums, submarines, isolation hospitals, asylums, sanatoriums, etc. Fishery, educational, shipping, financial, and medical departments are shown.  
People do not relish the idea of being dependent on their children in their old age. One need not elaborate the danger of being dependent. So, they want to invest (being the twelfth sign of the zodiac owned by a benefic) so that the money is safe and is useful as they are ever conscious of approaching old age. They will be helpful to others as they cannot refuse any request. Yet, they lend to those who can repay on demand. In spite of that, Saturn, as lord of eleven and twelve, threatens that a few friends - Saturnians - will be good friends until they receive the help and then disappoint the Pisces born. Never take a Saturnian as your private secretary as he will, on a later date, when you enter into a Saturn sub period, cause you anxiety and loss of prestige, honour, and money. Who are Saturnians? Those who are born either on Saturdays or in Capricorn or Aquarius as ascendant or in the star Pushyam, Anuradha, and Uthrapathrapada stars. Be doubly careful with them.  
The Sun forming a good aspect (as lord of six) shows permanent service in government departments. Mars, when favourable and strong, makes them serve in the navy, custom, port trust, and oil fields. They have plurality of interest. Jupiter as lord of ten makes one a politician or philosopher or serve in any of the departments indicated by Jupiter and, if allowed, to be in business also.  
#### Domestic Environments
People born under the sign of Pisces generally welcome many friends into their homes. They do not do this to entertain them, but rather because their guests will patiently listen to the narration of the troubles of Pisces-borns, pity them, and give them mental solace. They may even invite astrologers, as the 7th house is ruled by Mercury for astrologers.    
Pisces-borns are desirous of giving their children higher education, and they would also wish to have an educated partner in life. If their partner is not educated, they will try to educate them. They love a happy domestic life and are very affectionate at home. Throughout their married life, they strive to keep the romantic legend of lovers alive. One defect, as it appears to many, is that they are easily tempted by pretty faces and their fancies will wander. Many Pisces-borns are drawn to sculptures of different figures in temples, and they will stand for some time near cloth shops where they have kept figures of both sexes. This is due to the Moon, the lord of the 5th house, as every figure is a thrill for them and supplies them with enough food for imagination alone.  
#### Friends and Benefactors
As Pisces-borns are good by nature, kind by disposition, and very helpful, they will have many friends. Further, they have personal magnetism which adds more friends. However, their friends will take advantage of the Pisces-borns' willingness to sacrifice, forget their personal problems, and attend to the needs of their friends. Being a watery sign, belonging to benevolent Jupiter, they are influenced by their surroundings and environments. They worry themselves when their friends are in difficulties, and they enjoy when their good friends have fortune.  
They are very sincere and true to their friends, but they should be aware that not all of their friends are true and loyal. Some are outwardly honest but inwardly scoundrels, cheats, low-born, ill-bred, selfish people with a narrow mind. Therefore, Pisces-borns should not confide everything to their friends, as they may be betrayed and put into trouble by such few friends.  
#### Romance and Marriage
Pisces people prefer the beauty, intellectual pursuits, and fine arts of their partner. They do not want mean-minded partners, but they forget that such qualifications of the partner can lead to jealousy and suspicion, which can slowly kill their love. The partner should understand this suspicious nature of the Pisces-borns and try to assure them of their sincere love, and flatter them to their satisfaction. Pisces-borns will be ever dreaming about love and they will be delaying and postponing doing anything to develop it. They should not select any partner who is free with all.  
If Mars, ruling the second house, is the strongest significator, the partner will be bold, brave, and independent. If the Pisces-borns ill-treat the Martian type of partner, there can be no harmony at all. If Venus and Saturn form an evil aspect, the married life will be short and may end in a divorce. If Mercury is the strongest significator, the partner will be very clever, like a faithful animal, and will keep silent when the master is angry and fondle when the master is jolly. So, the partners will be tactful and clever. If Saturn is the strongest ruling planet, the Pisces-borns have to be a little careful and correct themselves, or else the partner will share the joy of Pisces-borns and, like a rat in a sinking ship, desert them when they are in difficulties.  
Pisces-borns can lead a happy life with Virgo-borns and Cancer-borns.  
#### Children
Jupiter, the lord of Pisces, is exalted in the fifth sign, Cancer, and the fifth house indicates offspring. This is likely why Piscesians love and adore their children, who reciprocate in kind. They are like a mirror, and will always return the same coin. Pisces-borns should not be too strict with their children, or else they will reap the consequences. If their children have not scored sufficient marks or are playful, they should be well advised and never threatened, as they will teach their parents a lesson. The children will usually be intelligent and successful in their lives, and often turn out to be good artists.  
If Pisces-borns are not moody and suspicious, they can be good social workers and lead a very happy and harmonious married life. Mars, Moon, and Saturn rule the houses that indicate children, which are 2, 5, and 11. Therefore, they will likely be rich business people dealing in mine products, metals, boilers, oils, etc.  
#### Lucky days for Pisces-borns
are Thursdays, Tuesdays, and Sundays. Mondays and Saturdays should be avoided, as they can lead to loss. Wednesdays and Fridays are inauspicious for Pisces-borns, but beneficial for their partners or opponents. Thursdays are best for profession, reputation, etc., Tuesdays for finance, higher studies, and long journeys, and Sundays for competition and overdraft facility. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are auspicious for making purchases for the partner, but Saturdays should be avoided for disputes and agreements.
#### Lucky colours for Pisces-borns
are red and yellow, rose and orange, while blue, white, cream, and green are good for their partners. A coral mounted in a gold ring may be used with advantage. Lucky numbers are 1, 4, 3, and 9, while 8 should be avoided.
#### Objects and professions indicated by Pisces
include politicians, ministers, bank agents, travellers, tourists, advocates, professors, generous people, religious-minded people, arbitrators, very rich persons, rulers, valuable dhanyam, corns, rishis, those who are charitable, who do penance and sacrifice, pearls, conch-shell, lotus, fragrant or aquatic flowers, salt, perfumes, gems, business people, literates, journalists, accountants, auditors, bankers, electric thermal station, etc.
#### Places indicated by Pisces
