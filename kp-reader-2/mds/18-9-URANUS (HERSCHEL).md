## URANUS (HERSCHEL)

The Discovery of Uranus

Nobody can state with authority who discovered the planets Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn, which are visible to the naked eye and which wander in the zodiac. No skill is needed to note the Sun and Moon, as one cannot miss them. Westerners are of the opinion that Mr. Seth was the first to divide the zodiac into 12 equal parts, and literature shows that ancient Chinese, Mayas, and Incas of South America, the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Egyptians, and others had realized the existence of these planets. (Probably, a week is distributed to these 7 planets, and there are 7 days in the week.)
But the Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed, was the first person to notice, between 1690 and 1715, on more than six occasions, the existence of Uranus. Later, a musician called Herschel discovered this planet and, according to the suggestion of Mr. Bode, he gave the name Uranus to this new planet. It is also named after him as "Herschel". Uranus is about 1782 million miles away from the Sun. The greater the distance from the Sun, the slower will be the movement in the zodiac. Therefore, Uranus is a slow-moving planet. It takes about 84 years to go around the Sun once. Its diameter is about 32,000 miles.
Since Uranus was not known to the ancient astrologers of India, there is no name in Sanskrit or any other Indian language for Uranus. A few beginners of astrology mistake Uranus as either Rahu or Kethu, and a few call it "Indra" without any authority.
Both the Westerners and the Hindus originally knew only 7 planets from the Sun to Saturn, and both allotted the 12 signs of the Zodiac to these 7 planets. The Sun and Moon were given Leo and Cancer, each only one sign, whereas the other five planets were allotted two signs each.
After Discovering Uranus, Westerners Considered That Uranus Governs the Central Nervous System and Offers Supreme Intelligence and Research Mind or Perverted Ideas

Uranus Causes Sudden Unexpected Results, Including Death. It Is Allotted Aquarius-Kumba, an Airy Sign. Sudden Death Is Due to Heart Failure, and Aquarius Is Opposed to the Sign Indicating the Heart, Leo. Therefore, Aquarius Is Allotted to Both Saturn and Uranus. It Is Not Established in Which Sign Uranus Will Be Exalted and Where It Will Be Debilitated, But Virgo-Kanni Is Allotted as the Sign of Exaltation to Uranus, as Long as Uranus Controls the Intelligence of a Native and Also the Nervous System.

Physical Features

Generally, those who have grown very tall will have a favourable connection of Uranus with the ascendant (one should not take the whole Lagna bhava for aspects, only the cusp should be taken). Further, Uranus in the signs Gemini, Aquarius, Sagittarius, and Leo will produce unusually tall persons. Uranus occupying the ascendant or forming a good aspect with the Lagna gives long limbs and a slender body. It will also give deep-set, penetrative eyes and good vision. However, if it afflicts the second cusp and also the planets Venus and Sun, it can cause a defect in the vision.

Diseases

If Uranus is in the ascendant or in the 6th house and forms an unfavourable aspect with the Sun, one may have heart trouble or epilepsy. Uranus in Aries can cause injuries to the head and headaches on one side, as well as difficulty sleeping. It is likely that the person will nod their head unknowingly and frequently. Uranus in Taurus can cause sore throats, swellings, mumps, and if it afflicts Mercury and the 2nd cusp, one may lose their voice. Uranus in Gemini can produce pneumonia, bronchial afflictions, asthma, hiccoughs, and coughs. Uranus in Cancer can give dyspepsia, fractures of the ribs, and ulcers in the breasts. Uranus in Leo can affect the vertebral column, spine, and heart. Uranus in Virgo can cause disorders in the digestive system and produce ulcers, as well as making the person feel as though they are suffering from some disease. A few may even experience electric shock. Uranus in Libra can represent inflammation of the kidneys, as well as stones in the bladder, diabetes, and pains in the hips. Uranus in Scorpio can cause hernias, hydroceles, diseases in the generative system, piles, and fistulas. Uranus in Sagittarius can threaten danger from animals, as well as tetanus, hydrophobia, injuries from falling off animals, and fractures of the hip and thigh. Uranus in Capricorn can cause rheumatism, dislocations, and fractures. Uranus in Aquarius can indicate suffocation, heart failure, and death due to poisonous gas. Finally, Uranus in Pisces can cause fractures, lameness, amputations, scurvy, scabies, or eczema.

Characteristics of Uranus

The advancement of science is generally signified by Uranus. Hence, people having Uranus strongly posited in their chart will be always after study, thinking, and contemplation. They are best suited for doing research and uncovering the truth. They do not want to simply follow traditions without convincing themselves. They will be inclined to study occultism and mesmerism; they gain such knowledge to heal diseases by their mental will, telepathy, television, electricity, astrology and other related studies. Those people with strong Uranus will have accurate intuition, keen foresight, quick action and constructive criticism. 
Uranus gives an independent spirit, original thought and speedy turnover. In love affairs, unless Uranus has beneficial aspects, the persons having strong Uranus with adverse aspects, will neither abide by law nor convention. They have their own law. It does not take them long to fall in love with one and neglect the other sex and also to divorce in no time, regardless of the law, morality and man-made rules. But a good aspect to Uranus makes one a builder of a society to do good and give lift to the associates. People who arrange marriages in their own way are usually not conventional, they do not mind what others feel or say. In their horoscopes, Uranus need not be afflicted. Mars may be a strong benefic. 
The most eccentric person would be one in whose horoscope Uranus and Mercury have adverse aspects.

Avoid Self-Destructive Actions

One should not entertain false ideas of independence; never be perverse either in thought or speech. Avoid violence and other self-destructive actions. Though one may prefer abrupt changes, it is advisable to judge properly whether it will bring any reversion and misfortune. Avoid blunt statements without any tact or diplomacy, as this will ultimately bring disfavour and opposition.
