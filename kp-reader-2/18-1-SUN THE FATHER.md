## Sun: The Father of the Stars
Astronomy tells us that the Sun is the parent of the entire solar system, and is also known as the "Father of the Stars". It is the nearest star to Earth, located about 93 million miles away. It is the largest of the planets in the solar system, being nearly 750 times larger than all the other planets combined. Its diameter is about 10 times that of Earth, and it has a circumference of nearly 27,19,000 miles.

Scientists believe that the Sun is not a solid mass, but is composed of gaseous matter in a series of layers. It emits cool and positive magnetic rays which interact with the negative qualities on Earth, creating heat and light. These waves also affect all the other planets in the solar system, though the intensity varies depending on various factors.

Mythology: Being the center of all life, force, and energy and the giver of prana, Sun is worshipped as Sun God. It is held in high esteem. At least thrice daily, Sun is prayed for by Hindus. Every Sunday, Surya Namaskaram is done by many persons to regain lost vitality and eyesight. Other nations also pay reverence to Sun; it is said to represent the other Creator, the Brahma, with his four faces to have a survey of all four directions causing four seasons and the four elements, namely, fire, earth, air, and water. Sundays (otherwise called Sabbath, meaning wise teacher) are given holidays probably to worship him. Sunday is also put at the head of all seven days of the week.
Westerners call the Sun, Apollo. They consider the Sun is the son of Jupiter and Latona. Apollo is the brother of Diana. He is adored by the Greeks. The swan and the raven are said to be Apollo's birds.
Hindus have conceived the Sun as ever moving in a chariot drawn by seven horses. This is probably because in the Sun are contained all seven colors of the solar spectrum (VIBGYOR). They say that Sun goes round the mount Meru daily. Whenever Sun enters into certain significant signs, the Hindus perform some religious function on those days to satisfy the departed soul and also offer prayers to Sun God. One such occasion is at the time when Sun crosses the fixed Nirayana Vernal Equinox and enters Aries so that people in the North Pole could see him after a continuous night extending to six months. This is called Vishu or Tamil New Year's Day. The next occasion is on or around July 17 when Sun reaches the northernmost declination (twenty-three degrees twenty-seven minutes from the celestial equator) and begins its southern course. It is called Dakshinayana. The next occasion when they perform the religious rites falls when Sun during its southern course reaches the Autumnal Equinox which is the beginning of Libra or Thulam. Three months later, when Sun reaches the southernmost declination in the south and just when he commences the northern course, all Hindus irrespective of caste or creed uniformly celebrate this day. It is called Sankaranthi. Thus, the Sun has come to occupy an important place in the Hindu Pantheon.

The Greatest Astrologer Varahamihira worshipped only the Sun God and shed an imperishable lustre among the nine gems in the court of King Vikramaditya. The Sun takes exactly one year to go round the ecliptic, and it only has a direct motion; it never retrogrades, and there is no latitude to the Sun.

Sun as a Symbol of Spirit
Hindus consider the Sun to be the soul of Kalapurusha. It is said that the several constituents of Kalapurusha are either strong or weak according to the strength of the planets representing them, with the exception of Saturn. When Saturn is weak, misery will be much greater and will predominate, but if Saturn is strong there will be less of misery. All these effects are felt only in their respective periods.

For all living beings, the Sun represents the positive and primal fount, while the Moon represents the negative influence in preservation and formative. The Sun is constructive and creative, while the Moon is the mother. Therefore, the Sun is the symbol of spirit and the Moon is that of matter, both acting as life and form. This is why the zodiac, which is divided into 12 signs, is in its nature alternatively positive and negative or masculine and feminine.

The Sun and Moon are considered to be the sovereign, while Guru or Jupiter and Sukra or Venus are the counselors or ministers. Budha or Mercury is their herald or the young prince, Kuja or Mars is the commander-in-chief, and Saturn or Sani is the slave of the servant. The Sun is the king and the Moon is the queen. Venus is considered to be the wife of Jupiter and the adviser.

Other names of the Sun are Adithya, Arka, Aruna, Bhanu, Dhinakara or Dhinakrit, Hell, Pusha, Ravi, Surya, and Thapana.

The Sun's Governance
The Sun and Moon are the two luminaries as they both emit light and make everything bright. The Sun has a form with dark eyes. It is the Sun that pours forth its spirit and it is the one planet that gives life to one and all. The Chaldeans worshipped the Sun with great love and devotion. The Sun offers us the power of resistance and vitality. It governs the inspiration and expiration, i.e., the breath of life. It also rules over our consciousness and denotes the individuality, while the form and personality are attributed to the Moon. The Sun gives the force and self-will and makes one determined and decisive.

The Sun is a dry, masculine, positive, and hot planet. It is 'Agni Devatha' and is fiery by nature. It rules the direction East and (of the six Rithus) 'Grishma' which includes the months of June and July. The colour of the Sun is orange or Kauakambaram. It rules the metal Gold and also Copper. The Sun represents the Father of the native. In a woman's chart, it indicates her husband. In service, it shows the master or the administrative head or the Government. In games, it stands for the captain or the leader.

Physical Features: People with the Sun as the ruling planet, born either on a Sunday or in Leo-Simha Lagna or with the Sun in the Ascendant, will have honey-coloured eyes. The face will be large and round. The hair and the colour of the body will have a light shade.

The Significance of the Sun in the Physical Body

The Sun rules the heart, and the sign which it governs, Leo Simha, denotes the heart of the Kala-purusha. It also represents the right eye in men and the left eye in women. The mouth, spleen, throat, and brain are also indicated by the Sun.

Diseases Caused by Sun Affliction
When the Sun is afflicted by another planet, it can cause defects in the heart or eyesight during the period of the Sun and the afflicting planet. Saturn afflicting the Sun causes low blood pressure, while Jupiter afflicting the Sun produces high blood pressure. Mars afflicting the Sun can cause haemorrhage, cardiac thrombosis, and other ailments. The constitution may be overheated and bilious. It can also denote cerebral meningitis, eruptions of the face, loss of speech due to cerebral affection (aphasia), sharp fevers, typhoid, polypus, epilepsy, bile complaints, sunstroke, scorches, and diseases of the head.

Characteristics of a Strong and Beneficial Sun
When the Sun is not afflicted but is strong and beneficial, it offers sterling qualities. It fosters real love towards everything and everybody, as well as devotion to God that is sincere and steady. Activity, authority, steadiness, soundness, and solidarity in one's avocation are all attributed to the Sun. It also indicates one's self-acquisition and the ability to make strenuous efforts, roam over mountains, undertake travels, and take all pains to gain one's objective. Maximum labour and minimum wages are also attributed to the Sun.

A strong Sun in a favourable sign offers strong will and a cheerful outlook towards life, as well as good fortune. However, one should not be too frank and outspoken, and should cultivate caution and secretiveness. The Sun gives power to rise far above the status in which one is born, as well as a magnetic quality and ambition. Sun's subjects are tireless workers, but should avoid boasting over others and should not be over-ambitious lest they should feel discontented or unhappy.

Those who have a strong Sun should go directly to seek favour from anybody, as the magnetic radiation of the Sun is carried with them and the person sought out cannot refuse to grant the request. By exercising self-control and limiting one's ambition, one will enjoy the good-will and the esteem of the people in powerful positions and also from the public. Similarly, high government officials can enjoy life and earn the good will of the public.

Beneficial Sun Gives Ambition, Boldness, Brilliance, Capacity to Command, Dignity, Energy, Elevation in Rank, Faith, Fame, Grace, Generosity, Health, Hope, Happiness, Individuality, Influence, Joy, Kind Heart, Kingly Appearance, Loyalty, Magnanimity, Nobility, Optimism, Power, Sterling Quality, Respect for Elders, Reputation, Royalty, Regality, Scruples, Success in Worldly Affairs, Truth, Good Temperament, Unadulterated Love, Vigour, Vitality, Virtue, and Warmth.

Profession
The Sun generally indicates a permanent position in life. All government services and those in such departments where there is security of service are denoted by the Sun. The Sun also indicates an independent business financed by the father or the business taken over from him. The Sun as an indicator of profession gives success to one who deals in red or orange articles, such as copper, gold, wheat, medicine, and chemicals. The nature of the profession will, however, largely depend on the combination of the Sun with other planets. 

For example, if the Sun is connected with the Moon and Mercury, the native will deal in red or orange clothes, as the Moon and Mercury jointly indicate textiles; alternatively, one may be employed with this combination in a government textile department, since the Sun represents government and the Moon and Mercury denote textiles. If the Sun has any connection with the Moon and Venus, the native may deal in red or orange paints or may serve in a transport or shipping department. If Mars and Mercury are connected with the Sun in any manner, the native may be a military engineer or may deal in brick kilns or serve in a government press, as Mars and Mercury indicate press or mechanical or military engineering, etc. The Sun, Mars, and Venus promise service, as Venus stands for vehicular traffic and transport and Mars for police in the traffic department. Those who deal in rose flowers will be influenced by these three planets, as Venus is for flowers, Mars shows his possession of landed property and red colour, and the Sun indicates thorny plants. 

The Sun having a relation with Saturn suggests that one will deal in woollen goods, as Saturn also denotes hair (export of hair collected from certain famous temples is done by one who is born Cancer having the Sun in Karthik 1st pada aspected by exalted Saturn). For people who enter into the medical services as indicated by the Sun, the following combinations of planets will indicate the nature of their specialisation: the Sun with Jupiter produces good physicians and Mercury gives intuition and helps to diagnose correctly; the Sun receiving beneficial aspects from Mars brings out able surgeons, as Mars indicates the use of sharp instruments; the Sun, Venus, and Jupiter help specialisation in maternity, since the Sun denotes medicine, Venus women, and Jupiter the chief governor for children; if Venus receives aspects from the active and bold Mars and the secretive Saturn and is conjoined with the Sun, the person will be an expert in venereal diseases; if the Sun and Saturn are mutually connected, the person will specialise in skin diseases, as Saturn spoils the beauty given by Venus; the Sun and Venus devoid of other planets' influence occupying the sixth or the eighth house show that he will be an optician; and the Sun and Saturn in the Ascendant or in the 8th house indicate that one will earn as a dentist.

In one's chart, the Ascendant shows the native and the 7th house indicates the patient whom they treat. If the 2nd and 12th houses are afflicted, one has an eye defect or disease. Therefore, the 2nd and 12th houses from the 7th are the 8th and 6th houses counted from the Ascendant. Therefore, the planets Sun and Venus in the 6th and 8th in the medical officer's chart show that they will attend to people suffering from eye diseases.

One suffers from toothache only when the 2nd and 7th houses are afflicted. Therefore, the 2nd and 7th houses counted from the 7th house representing the patient are the 8th and Ascendant of the doctor. Hence, dentists will have Sun and Saturn having a connection with these two houses. Furthermore, Saturn rules the osseous system, bones, enamel, etc. Sun and Mercury in the 9th or 5th house indicate that the native will be an expert in Ear, Nose and Throat diseases, as the 3rd and 11th houses denote ear and throat.

If Rahu, Sukra, Sun, Uranus and the lord of the 9th house are in any manner connected with each other, the medical man will specialize in X-ray. If Uranus has a connection only with the Sun, the native will serve in the medical research department. Generally, Sun and Jupiter having a connection with Virgo or Kanni, Scorpio or Vrischika show service in the Public Health department, whereas Sun and Mars indicate service in the medical department. Similarly, if one takes to other departments of the Government, for example law, then Jupiter with Sun and Mercury indicates civil laws, whereas Mars indicates Criminal Law.

To find out one's profession exactly, a deep study is necessary.

Precious Stones: Diamond and Ruby
If the Sun is weak or afflicted, one can use metal gold and the stones diamond and ruby set in it. Those who suffer from heart trouble, eye diseases, or those who want security in service or power in government, or favour from high government officials, can use the above gems to enjoy health and success. They will be able to realize their ambition.

So far, the general results of the Sun have been discussed. However, the general results will not apply to everyone without modifications. It will vary according to the houses which it occupies at the time of birth of a person.
