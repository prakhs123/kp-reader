SUN THE FATHER
Astronomy: Sun is the parent of the entire solar system. It is also called the 'Father of the Starsâ€™. It is the nearest star to the earth and is about 93 million miles away from our mother earth. It is the largest among the planets, belonging to the solar system. It is nearly 750 times larger than all the planets put together. Its diameter is abouti10 times that of the earth and is nearly 27,19,000 miles in circumference.
Scientists say that it is not a solid mass, but they are of the opinion that it is composed of gaseous matter in a series of layers which sent out cool and positive magnetic rays which meet one of the negative quality on earth, so that heat and light, both are developed. The waves effect like-wise all other planets belonging to the solar system. The intensity varies and it depends on many factors.

Mythology: Being the centre of all life, force and energy and the giver of prana, Sun is worshipped as
 Sun God. It is held in high esteem. At least thrice daily, Sun is prayed for by Hindus. Every Sunday
 Surya Namaskaram is done the many persons to regain the lost vitality and eye-sight. Other nations also pay reverence to Sun it is said to represent the
 Other Creator, the Brahma, with his four faces to have a survey of all the four directionS causing four seasons and the four elements, namely, Fire Earth,
 Air and Water, Sundays (otherwise called Sabbath, meaning wise teacher) are given holidays probably to worship
him. Sunday is also put at the head of all the seven days of the week.
Westerners call the Sun, Apollo. They consider the Sun is the son of jupiter and Latona. Apollo is the brother of Diana. He is adored by the Greeks. The swan and the raven are said to the Apollo's birds.
Hindus have conceived the Sun as ever moving in a chariot drawn by seven horses. This is probably because in the Sun are contained all the seven colours of the solar spectrum (VIBGYOR). They say that Sun goes round the mount Meru daily. Whenever Sun enters into certain significant signs, the Hindus perform some religious function on those days to satisfy the departed soul and also offer prayers to Sun
 God. One such occasion is at the time when Sun crosses the fixed Nirayana Vernal Equinox and enters
 Aries so that people in the North Pole could see him after a continuous night extending to six months.
 This is called Vishu or Tamil New Year's Day. The next occasion is on or around July 17 when Sun reaches the northermost declination (twenty three degrees twenty seven minutes from the celestial equator) and begins its southern course. It is called
 Dakshinayana. The next occasion when they perform the religious rites falls when Sun during its southern course reaches the Autumnal Equinox which is the beginning of Libra or Thulam. Three months later, when Sun reaches the southernmost declination in the south and just when he commences the
 Northern course, all Hindus irrespective of caste or creed uniformly celebrate this day. It is called
 Sankaranthi. Thus the Sun has come to occupy an important place in the Hindu Pantheon.

The greatest Astrologer Varahamihira worshipped only
 Sun God and shed an imperishable lustre among the nine gems in the court of King Vikramaditya.
The Sun takes exactly one year to go round the ecliptic. It has only the direct motion. Never does it retrograde. Also there is no latitude to Sun.

Sun stands to us a symbol of spirit. Hindus consider that Sun is the soul of Kalapursha. (The Moon is his mind; Budha or Mercury his speech; Kuja or Mars his strength; Jupiter Guru his knowledge and happiness
 Venus or Sukra his desire or lust; Saturn is his misery; etc. It is said that the several constiuents of Kalapurusha are either strong or weak according to the strength of the planets representing them. Only Saturn is exempted.
 Whenever Saturn is weak, misery will be much greater and will predominate. But if Saturn is strong there will be less of misery. All these effects are felt only in their respective periods.)
 For all living beings, Sun represents the positive and primal fount whereas Moon represents the negative influence is preservation and formative, Sun is the father and Sun is constructive and creative while Moon is the mother. Therefore Sun is the symbol of spirit and Moon is that of matter, both acting as life and form. That is why the zodiac which is divided into 12 signs are in their nature alternatively positive and negative or masculine and feminine.
 The Sun and Moon are considered to be the sovereign whereas Guru or Jupiter and Sukra or
 Venus are the consellors or Ministers. Budha or
Mercury is
their fear or the young prince, Kuja or Mars is the commander-in-chief and Saturn or Sani is the slave of the servant. Sun is the king and Moon is the queen.
 Venus is considered to be the wife of Jupiter and the adviser.

 Bhanu, Dhinakara or Dhinakrit, Hell, Pusha, Ravi,

The nature of the profession will however largely depend on the combination of the Sun with other planets. If, for example, Sun is connected with Moon and Mercury, the native will deal in red clothes or orange clothes as Moon and Mercury jointly indicate textiles; alternatively one may be employed with this combination in a government textile department since

In one's chart the Ascendant shows the native and the 7th house indicates the patient whom he treats. If the 2nd and the 12th houses are spoiled, one has eye defect or disease. So the 2nd and the 12th houses from the 7th are the 8th and the 6th houses counted from the Ascendant. Therefore the planets
 Sun and Venus in 6 and 8 in the medical officer's chart show that he will attend on people suffering from eye diseases.
One suffers from tooth-ache only when the 2nd and the 7th houses are afflicted. There fore the 2nd and the 7th houses counted from the 7th house representing the patient are the 8th and the Ascendant, of the doctor. Hence dentists will have Sun and Saturn having connection with these two houses. Further,
