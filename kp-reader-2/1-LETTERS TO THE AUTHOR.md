## Letters to the Author
Dear Sir,  
Namaskarams,

I have been interested in learning Astrology and have gone through various Tamil texts written by various authors. I have found it difficult to find definite results or conclusions when a horoscope is taken for analysis and can only obtain rough predictions which mostly fructify adversely.
After I came in contact with your popular magazine ‘Astrology & Athrishta' and became a subscriber of the same, I did not hesitate to obtain your most valuable works 'Krishnamurti Padhdhati', Vols. 1 & 2 and also the 'Table of Houses’ by Raphael for Northern Latitudes.
Your works are of immense value to me and when I went through the pages of the 2nd vol. i.e., pages 166 to 169 regarding scholarship for study for higher education, I was struck with wonder to note the example and analysis. It reminded me to compare and verify with a horoscope which I had just erected with the aid of your works and the Table of Bhavas.
I verified the chart by applying your K.P. and was surprised to find it most accurate in finding the results of past and present occurrences that the native has been experiencing.

Sincerely,  
V. Balakrishanmurthi Chinnasalem

Dear Sir,

Krishnamurthi Padhdhati in Astrology is a great achievement in Indian Astrology and Predictive Stellar Astrology. On the basis of this Padhdhati, the results are one hundred percent correct. ‘Astrology and Athrishta', the monthly magazine, is a gem of an astrological magazine published throughout the world.
I pray to the Goddess Bhadrakali to grant long life to Jyotish Marthand Professor K.S. Krishnamurthi so that he may continue to serve the nation in this great subject.

Thanking you,  
Yours faithfully,   
Professor S.R. Janardhana Rao, B.A.

Dear Brother Krishnamurti, 

I am a student of Astrology and have purchased both volumes of your incredible book, "Krishnamurti Padhdhati". I am reading it carefully and enjoying each chapter. This book is your personal contribution to Astrology and will remain permanent. Your original thinking, deep insight into the subject, and angelic predictions have captivated my imagination.
I had intended to join your classes at Delhi this year, but due to my need to take my M.A. examination for improvement of Division, I was unable to do so.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,

It has indeed been my good fortune and proud privilege to have been introduced to you and to have heard your scholarly and entertaining address, spiced with humour. I had previously been misled by a mistaken impression that lecturers on astrology would be dull, drab, and insipid. However, I found your predictions to be interesting and enthusiastic. Your lecture has left a deep and abiding impression, and I wish to become a devoted disciple with no material interest except to gain a working knowledge, if not mastery, of "Krishnamurti Padhdhati".
I am very happy to learn that my friend Swamy has been your student and disciple. Swamy is a gentleman who needs no description. Your association with him might have already revealed to you his sincerity and devotion to his guru. I would consider myself fortunate to meet you at the earliest opportunity. We can benefit from the blessings of elderly and divine people like you.

Thanking you,  
Yours faithfully,  
M.S. Srinivasachary, M.A.

Respected Guruji,

I cannot help but express my admiration for your Padhdhati. I have read many books by various well-known authors, but none have given me the same satisfaction as your work. Your Ayanamsa also gives wonderfully accurate results, which I have tested on numerous known horoscopes to great success.
It is a testament to your greatness that you have not kept your knowledge a secret, but have instead tried to spread it in a clear and scientific manner. I am writing this to express the feelings I have in my mind, though I do not have the words to do it justice. You are truly great and divine grace is at your support.
I would be grateful if you could instruct your office to send me a copy of each of your books whenever they are published.

With kindest regards and best wishes,  
Yours affectionately,  
T.C. Malhan

Respected Sir,  
I began studying astrology in 1960, as I did not have the opportunity to do so earlier. I purchased books on astrology from various authors, totaling Rs.400/-, until 1965. However, I was not satisfied as there were too many rules and each author had different interpretations.
In October 1965, I came into contact with your magazine "Astrology & Athrishta" and purchased your valuable works "Krishnamurthi Padhdhati". I then became a subscriber of your magazine and am now able to cast horoscopes and read out events. However, I feel that I should first receive your "Ashirwad" in order to confidently predict using your system.
Therefore, I would be immensely grateful if you could bless me with a letter of "Ashirwad".
I remain,  

Yours obediently,
