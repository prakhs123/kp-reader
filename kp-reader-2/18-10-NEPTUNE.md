## Neptune
Neptune is the eighth giant planet. It is far away in space and cannot be seen without the aid of a powerful telescope. On average, it is 2,793 million miles from the Sun and has a diameter of about 27,600 miles. It weighs about 17 times the Earth. It was discovered by Mr. Galle and Challis in 1846. It revolves around the Zodiac in about 1461/2 years. As Neptune has not yet completed one round since its position in its orbit was fixed in 1846, the nature of Neptune, its influence on animate and inanimate objects, and the modifications while it transits in each sign have not yet been fixed. However, regular and systematic observation of the general nature of Neptune has been assessed in some way.

Neptune is the octave of Mercury, while Uranus is that of Venus. Uranus acts on the love-nature, while Neptune works on the spiritual side. Mercury governs the brains, improving the intellect of people and lifting them above animals, making them human; but Neptune improves spirituality and makes them divine.

As there are only twelve houses in the Zodiac and they had been allotted to the seven planets prior to the discovery of Uranus and Neptune, there is no separate house for them. However, considering its nature, Neptune is said to govern the sign Pisces (Meena), as the Greeks consider Neptune as the Poseidon king of the sea.

Neptune offers psychic-ability, feelings, inspiration, and emotion. It gives the power to foresee and increases one's passion. One may practice and try to have clairvoyance or crystal-gazing, hypnotism, mesmerism, thought-reading, or spiritual development, or to control devils or act as a medium with the spirit. It gives imagination and is thus beneficial to poets, musicians, artists, and painters. Neptune makes one dreamy, imaginative, or learn black-magic or be religious, paradoxical, impressionable, or make one an extreme in love affairs, secret attachments, or stealthily having pleasure with strange characters. It is difficult to understand people who are governed by Neptune.

If Neptune is afflicted, one will not be steady, always fond of changes, not reliable, confused, cynical, and treacherous. They will think of evil alone, conspire, and try to do harm to others. They may even commit murder by giving an overdose of drugs, poison, narcotics, or opium.
