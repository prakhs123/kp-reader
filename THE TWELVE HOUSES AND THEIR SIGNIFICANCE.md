## The Twelve Houses and Their Significance
All matters are distributed among the twelve houses and each house influences certain matters. One must judge a particular house or a few houses for any particular affair. What each house denotes is discussed below.
House is measured from cusp to cusp. Therefore, the Lagna Bhava or first house commences from the point that just rises in the east and extends up to the second cusp and the whole area is above the horizon. That which has risen just before birth and extends upwards in the eastern horizon is the twelfth Bhava.

### Lagnam The First Bhava
Lagnam: Adya (first); Kalpa Udhayam (ascending); Janma (birth); Seersea (head); Dhanus (physical body); Anga (limb); Deham (physical features); Varthamana (living or livelihood).

The First House, or what is commonly known as the Ascendant (Lagna), signifies the native, their general appearance, character and temperament. It shows their physical stature, colour, form and shape, and constitution in general. The Ascendant is always an important factor in the matter of health. Good aspects to the cuspal degree of the Ascendant portray good health, while bad aspects threaten ill health during the period of the planets throwing the bad aspect. It also indicates the native's vitality and vigor, their peculiar habit of thinking, their natural disposition and tendencies, the native's personality and struggle for life, their success or failure in attempts (1st, 10th and 11th houses), their fortune or misfortune, etc. One should examine the 1st, 3rd and 8th houses to ascertain the probable span of one's life. The Ascendant also describes the native's station in life, general candour (status), honour, dignity, prosperity and general well-being. One should guess from the first house whether one has the determination and courage to push forward and forge ahead. The Ascendant, according to Hindu sages, shows the native's residence abroad. Therefore one should examine this house before one predicts whether the native will live in their own place or will make fortune in a far-off place. 

In short, this house is the significator of any changes in the individual's life. Hence this is of supreme importance. All depend upon the occupant and aspects to the Ascendant.

The First House Governs the Head and Upper Part of the Face.

In Mundane Astrology, the Ascendant of a country signifies the people in the country, the general state of the locality, or the state for which the horoscope is cast.

In Horary Astrology, the First House may be said to symbolize the person asking the question.

Bhattothpala says in 'Prasnajnana' that longevity, age, birth, health, happiness, virtues, suffering, one's form and complexion should be investigated from the first house. Limbs (growth of the limbs), happiness, misery, hair, appropriating other's money (if Saturn and Mercury are in the Ascendant and afflicted by Jupiter, the individual will not hesitate to misappropriate), gambling on other's money or for others, skin, sleepiness (whether the native will be active or sleepy) - if Saturn is in the lagna, especially with malefics Kethu or Rahu, then the native will be lazy; if Mars and Mercury are there then he will be ever active. Kalidasa adds that tendency to insult other men, freedom from disease, perseverance in the breeding of cattle (lord of 6 in the lagna or connected with the lord of lagna), loss of decorum and blame from one's kinsmen are all to be predicted from the first house. The lagna indicates advantages, gains, and profit to the younger brother and his friends.

The Significance of the Ascendant

The name, fame, reputation, and patrimony of the mother are attributed to the Ascendant. Higher studies, long journeys, life in a hostel during studies, and connections with strangers and foreigners for the native's children (especially the first child) are judged from the Ascendant. Danger to the maternal uncle and the end of open inimical activity is to be read from the first house. The demise of the partner, wife, or husband, and the pleasurable pursuits and speculation of the father are also included. Short journeys, editing, publishing, and neighbours to the elder brother are pre-shadowed by the Ascendant.

Thus, each house signifies certain matters concerning the individual and the same house indicates various matters relating to the relatives of the native. A house may be fortunate to the native and at the same time it may be unlucky to a relative. The native may keep good health but visit the hospital to attend to an ailing relative and be worried because of the relative. house.

### The Second House Governs Second Marriage
This is so because the 2nd house is the 8th to the 7th representing the first wife and it is generally after the death of the first wife that one will go in for second marriage. Though marriage is largely the concern of the 7th house, the second house should also be referred to ascertain the time of marriage, description of partner, and the state of married life. The second house also represents (i) vision or the power of observation, (ii) the right eye (generally eye) (the 12th house is said to govern the left eye), (iii) memory, and (iv) imagination. The other parts of the physical body governed by the 2nd house are the nail, tongue, nose, teeth, cheeks, and chin. Evil planets in the second house cause mole or scar in that part of the body; mole is found from infancy, but scar is formed when the person runs the period of the planet afflicting the second house.
One has to investigate the second house to find out whether the native protects others and whether he gains or loses through those dependent on him. Also, whether he has good understanding or misunderstanding with family members. If benefic planets occupy the 2nd house, then the native will have good understanding with his family. If malefics are there, then he will have no easy time with them, whenever he runs the periods or sub-periods of the malefics. If the lord of 6 is in the 2nd house and afflicted, then estrangements with the maternal uncle or aunt will be common. The second house also concerns law suits, uses of ordinary or costly metal (the metal depending upon the planet), his or her trade and business according to the nature of the planets posited and profit or loss thereby, the native's ability to buy and sell, and faith in ancient culture and custom (if lord of 12 is in 2). This house suggests whether the person will be extravagant or economical. If Saturn is in the 2nd house he will be economical and slow in speech. If Mars were to be there, the native will be extravagant and outspoken in speech. If Jupiter were to occupy the second house, then one will earn through fair means and also spend rightly. Further, he will speak well. The 2nd house has to do with loans, money lent or money borrowed by a person, money employed in speculation, etc., money left with a guardian, trust, etc.
Being a marakasthana, the second house shows the death of the individual; the kind or type of death is influenced by the 8th house. The 3rd house indicates one's span of life. 12th to any house is the detrimental one to the house matters. Therefore, 12th to the 3rd house is the second. Hence, 2nd house is a marakasthana. The 8th house also signifies one's span of life. 12th to the 8th house is the 7th. Hence, 7th house is the other marakasthana. (Sthana means house; Maraka means death).
This house, along with the 5th house, has to be considered to find out whether one has the aptitude for music. If the 2nd house is an airy sign, then the native may turn out to be a vocalist. If Mars, Saturn, and Venus are connected with the 2nd house, he may take to tabla or mridangam and prove successful. If the 2nd house falls in any airy sign and of short ascension, he will take to flute. Lord Krishna plays on flute. Why? His star was Rohini in Taurus. Second house is Gemini, an airy sign of short ascension. Hence, he has flute. If of long ascension, he would do well to take to nayanam (nadaswaram). If the 2nd house happens to be a watery sign, then he may take to jaladarangam. Neptune shows stringed instruments.
In questions relating to affairs of nations, this house signifies national wealth, banking activities, and all matters concerning revenue.

In Horary Questions, the Second House Denotes the Money of the Querist, Their Loss or Gain in Speculations Relating to Business and Pecuniary Affairs or Any Question in Particular (First, Second, and Eleventh Houses); Also of Loans, Etc.

According to the Uttara Kalamritam, the Following Are to Be Guessed from the Second House: Belief in Sacred Tradition, Truth and Falsehood, Tongue, Eyes, Nails, Garment; Copper, Diamond, Gem, Pearl, Trade, Softness of Speech, Perfume (Incense), to Support Others, Effort in Acquisition of Wealth, Miserliness or Liberality, Clear Oratorical Ability, Gold, Good Silver, Corn, Cereals, Nose, Rules of Going, and a Close Dependent.

In Prasnajana, Bhattotpala Avers That One Should Look for Pearls, Ruby, Gems, Minerals, Wealth, Clothes, and Business from the Second House
While the second house shows gain to the native, it also indicates loss to the younger brother and changes in life in a foreign place. Malefics in the second house threaten loss to the native and imprisonment of the younger brother. The second house also includes gifts given by the younger brother to the native. Mother's gains and her elder brother are indicated by the second house, as it is the eleventh to the fourth; rank, position, profession, and success of children are judged from the occupants of the second Bhava and the aspects to the second house. Beneficial aspects give rise in its period, and malefics do harm in their periods if there are both harmonious and disharmonious aspects and if both benefics and malefics are present in the second house.

The Second House of the Native Shows a Long Journey of the Maternal Uncle, Danger to Partner or a Share of Profits to Partner, and the Common Disease of the Native's Father. The Elder Brother's Purchase of a House, Land, or Vehicle is Found from the Malefics Occupying the Second House.

### Third House
Dhairya (courage, firmness); Duschikya (bad thoughts); Uras (breast); Karna (ear), especially the right ear; Vikrama (prowess); Parakra ma; Bhratru (brother or sister); Virya (heroism) depending on the planet; Pourusham (mental strength).

This house rules one's mental inclination and ability, memory, and the inherent propensities of the mind and intellect. The third house indicates an inclination to study, and the ninth house stands for higher education, research, wisdom, and philosophical tendencies.

This Is the House of Courage, Firmness, Valour, Prowess, and Heroism
If the Lord of 10th or 6th House has a Connection with the 3rd House in any Manner, then the Native May Be a Soldier or an Army Officer Depending on Other Considerations. The 3rd House Is the Bhrathrusthana and Represents the Native's Younger Brother or Sister. Cousins, Kindred, Casual Acquaintance, and Neighbours Are Also Governed by This House. Being the Sahayasthana, One Should Refer to the 3rd House to Ascertain Whether the Native Has the Assistance of Others or Is Individually Working Hard.

The Third House also deals with short travel. If the Third House is well connected, one may undertake small inland journeys such as travel by cycle, bus, tram, land, railway, crossing rivers and lakes, and short air travel. The Ninth House has to be looked at for long journeys, journeys to far-off places, and sea or air journeys to long distances. All kinds of correspondence and letters, papers, writing, accounting, mathematics, news of transit, means of communication such as cycle, bus, train, rail, etc., post offices, letter boxes, telephone, telegraph, teleprint, television, telecommunication, radio reports, signal, airmail, etc. belong to this house. 
If the Third House or its lord has any connection whatsoever with Houses Two, Six, or Ten, one can take up agency and do commission business. He can also be a broker, representative, mediator, messenger, publicity officer, etc. If the Fourth House or its lord has any connection, then the native can engage himself as an estate broker. Since the Third House signifies books and publications (magazines), one can become an editor, newspaper reporter, news correspondent, information officer, journalist, etc. The Third House also governs change of residence (being in 12 to the Fourth House), restlessness, want of peace, all movement, transition and change, library, bookstore, bargain, signature signing contracts or agreements, rumours of all kinds, conveying of messages, carrying tales etc. Kethu in the Third House makes one a duplicate "Narada". The parts of the body ruled by the Third House are ears (especially right ear), hands, throat, shoulder blade, collar bone, arms, and the nervous system.

If, in a lady's chart, the lord of the third house, which is a natural benefic, is posited in the second house, the native may put on jewels on her ears, hands, and neck, which are ruled by the third house.

If Rahu or Kethu is conjoined with Mars or the lord of the sixth house, or if Rahu or Kethu is placed in the third house along with Mars, then ear disease may result. Generally, malefics occupying any house will affect the part of the body ruled by that house. If malefics occupy the third house, there may be a mole in the part of the body governed by the third house.

If the Lord of Ten is in Three, the native is likely to get employment. If they are a doctor, then they may deal in ear diseases (ENT Specialist).

In State Astrology, the Third House Shows Neighbouring Countries and Treaties with Them

It also rules over transportation, whether it be aerial, rail, postal, road, telegraph, radio, or telephone. This also represents libraries and public education generally.

In Uttara Kalamritam, it is mentioned that the third house denotes ears, battle, roadside place, confusion of the mind, causing sorrow, soldier, one's own relations (brothers and sisters), throat, eating unspoiled or pure food, partition of property, the part of the hand between the forefinger and the thumb (sacred to the Manes), female servant, journey in a small good vehicle, and one's own religious duty.

In the Jataka Parijatam, the revered author explains that the welfare of the younger brothers, such as enterprise, tone, ear, select ornaments, articles of apparel, steadiness, valour, strength, and edible roots and fruits, can be seen from the third house.

Prediction Based on Saturn and Mars in the 3rd House

When predicting how courageous someone will be, it is important to consider the position of Saturn and Mars in the 3rd house. If Saturn is in the 3rd house, the person will be cautious and will wait and see before taking any bold action. On the other hand, if Mars is in the 3rd house, the person will be very brave and will act on the spur of the moment. For example, if two people are standing on the bank of a river and they see a stranger who is not a swimmer fall into the river, the person with Saturn in the 3rd house will hesitate to help, as they will want to be sure of their own safety, whereas the person with Mars in the 3rd house will immediately plunge into the river to try and save the person who is about to be drowned.

Health of Younger Brother, Success or Failure, Loss or Investment by Mother, Gains to Children or Friends of Children, Rank and Position of Maternal Uncle, Long Journey or Higher Studies of Partner, Birth of Children to Elder Brother or Sister:

Judging from the 3rd House, it is a maraka house to father. In most horoscopes, Rahu in the 3rd house causes father's death during its period or sub period. Suppose one is running the period or sub period of the significator of the 3rd house. If the native's mother has suffered a loss and the native's child's friend has visited the place and their character is doubtful, then it is likely that this friend of the child is the culprit who caused the loss to the native's mother.

### Fourth House:
The fourth house corresponds to the feminine sign Cancer (Kataka) ruled by the Moon, which is identified by Hindus as Goddess Parvathi. Hindu sages have attributed the fourth house to the mother, while Westerners consider it to be the house for the father, which is not supported by wise Hindu astrologers. The fourth house relates to one's home, residence, domestic environments, and the general condition of the native in the later part of their life. This house is also called the 'grave', meaning that it is concerned with all hidden things such as private affairs, curious secrets, and secret life. If the beneficial Saturn were to occupy this house and receive good aspects from the lords of 2 and 11, one may hoard their savings. The fourth house also shows one's landed or immovable property, those holdings which one takes on lease or rent, and those rented or leased out to other people. It denotes whether one will have their own vehicles or enjoy others', and all permanent possessions such as fields, pastures, corn-fields, farms, orchards, mines, real estate, gardens, buildings, ancient dwellings, monuments, and antiquities are influenced by this house.



The fourth house should also be examined in connection with patrimony (all inheritance descending in a direct line, hereditary properties, and treasures hidden underground).

This House Has an Impact on Education and Qualifications of a Person
In this respect, the Fourth House may be taken to indicate school and collegiate education, in contrast to higher education and research, which is denoted by the Ninth House. The Third House relates to the mental inclination to study a particular subject.

The Fourth House Holds Significance to the Termination, Conclusion, and End of Every Undertaking, Whether in Nativity or Horary Astrology.

In State Astrology, the fourth house governs mines, gardens, public buildings, crops, agriculture and determines the outcome of any undertaking.

Kalidasa Says in Uttara Kalamritam: The Following Are to Be Guessed from the Fourth Bhava

Learning Vehicles Similar to Rickshaws, Small Boats and the Like, Mother, Oil Bath, Relations, Caste, Small Well, Water, Milk as Medicine or Great Supernatural Efficacy (Sun in 4 Well Aspected by Uranus), Trust, False Allegation, a Tent or Pavilion, Digging a Pond or Well and Their Installation for Public Use, Mansion Art, Entrance into a House, Conclusion, Disposition, Loss of One's Dwelling, Paternal Property, Celestial Food, the Art of Finding Out Where Stolen Property is Kept, Development of Vedic and Secret Texts, Cows, Buffaloes and Abundance of Corn, Gain, etc. Produced in Wet Lands

Bhattotpala is of the view that the fourth house has to do with great herbs, treasures, and entering holes or caves.

If the fourth house and Mars are favourable during their conjoined periods, one will buy land. If they are unfavourable, he may sell away or there could be a loss through the investment in land, buildings, etc.

If the fourth house and Venus are beneficial, one will possess a car or any other vehicle when they run the conjoined period of the significator of the fourth house and Venus, or any planet connected with Venus.

If there is an evil aspect, then during their period together one can incur heavy expenses due to the vehicle, have an accident, or sell the conveyance and suffer without the usual transport they enjoyed.

If the fourth house significator and Moon receive good aspects, he will have a long-living and helpful mother with a good understanding and relationship. If they are afflicted by adverse aspects, one may lose their mother or have an unfriendly relationship.

Fourth House Indicates Bank Position of Younger Brother, Health of Mother, Loss to Children (Children May Go to Another Place), Gains to Maternal Uncle, Inherited Property, Popularity, Prosperity, and Profession of Partner; Danger to Father as It Is the Eighth House to the Ninth, Open Enemies of Elder Brother, Since Fourth House Is the Sixth Counted from the Eleventh House; Twelfth House Indicates Secret Enemies. Their Speculative Activities, Their Children, Etc., Are Also Shown by the Fourth House. The significations of the fifth house are Rajanta (sovereign's mark), Kara (tax or toll), Buddhi (intellect), Tanaya (children), Putra (son), Jatara (belly), Sruti (Vedic knowledge), Smriti (traditional law), and Poorvapunya (virtuous act previously done).

### The Fifth House 
The Fifth House Presides Over Pleasure, Society, and Social Inclinations

The fifth house presides over pleasure, society, and social inclinations. It deals with tastes and fancies, artistic talents, and property derived through a wife or business partner's luck. This house denotes the type of recreation, entertainment, amusements, sports, romance, and similar interests that appeal to a person. It is connected with all material and physical pleasures, such as games, sports, cinema, opera, drama, music, dance, banquets, merriment, and amusements of all sorts. It also indicates places of entertainment.

The Fifth House: A Trine House Indicating 'Poorva Punya Sthana'

The fifth house is a trine house, indicating 'poorva punya sthana', which shows what meritorious deeds one could have done in the previous birth. It is also concerned with speculative affairs and all matters of enterprise prompted by the desire nature. All games of chance, such as cards, crossword puzzles, dice, horse racing, shares, lotteries, gambling, betting, and stock exchange, come under the domain of the fifth house.

The Native's Love Affairs

The degree of success or failure achieved in love affairs, courtship, and licentiousness, the legitimate and illegitimate attraction and social intercourse between the sexes prior to wedlock and after marriage come under this house; also, kidnap, rape, and other such matters. It may be said to represent the seat of the physical and magnetic attractions between the opposite sexes.

In Questions Relating to National Affairs, the Fifth House Indicates Envoys, Ambassadors, Banquets, Etc.

According to Uttara Kalamritam, the following also have to be determined from the 5th house: good morals, mechanical art, discretion (weighing the merits and demerits of a thing), discrimination between virtue and sin, prayer by incantations, chanting of Vedic hymns, religious-mindedness, deep pondering, profound learning and wisdom, enormous riches, hereditary post, festive occasions, intense satisfaction, a long literary production, an umbrella, a great desirable action, paternal property, liaisons with courtesans, and the gift of cooked rice.

The author of Jataka Parijatham makes it clear that a person's tutelary deity, intelligence, son, religious merit, and ruler or sovereign are to be ascertained from the 5th house. According to him, pilgrimage has to be predicted taking the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 11th bhavas into account, with visits to far-off places being found out with reference to the 12th bhava. Malefics in the second house show separation from family, which may include a journey. The 5th house connected with malefics will bring in separation from children, while benefics in the 5th indicate visits to holy places to fulfill one's vow. The 10th house shows pilgrimage to holy places or journeys on duty.

Fifth House Shows That One Will Be Inclined to Take Risks and Speculate. One May Speculate; Their Gains or Losses Are Shown by the Planet with Which the Lord of the Fifth House Is Conjoined or Aspected. Additionally, Bad Aspects to the Fifth House Cusp from the Lord of the Fifth, Eighth, or Twelfth Houses Show Gains in Speculation. (This Is My Unfailing Finding; Research Students Can Verify.)

Fifth House Indicates Short Journeys, Publications of the Next Younger Brother, Mother's Bank Position, One's Own Child's or the Second Younger Brother's (Younger to the Next Younger Brother) Health, Success or Failure, Their Characteristics, Fortune etc., Changes in Maternal Uncle's Position, His Loss or Hospitalisation of Pet Animals, Sixth House Indicates Pet Animals, and Twelfth House Shows Hospitalisation (Fifth House is the Twelfth to the Sixth).

The Sixth House: The House of Sickness
The sixth house is known as the house of sickness. It indicates disease and sickness, the real state of the disease, recovery from it, and whether it is of a long or short duration. The sixth house is concerned with disease, the twelfth house with hospitalization, and the eleventh house, which is twelve to the twelfth house and six to the sixth house, governs discharge from hospital. This is an important house for those who have to do with nursing and treatment of the sick. It is also related to food and dietary habits, and all health is often due to improper care of the body and inattention to the diet most suited.

Mercury in the Sixth House Shows Fads and Fancies Regarding Diet

Saturn in this Position Indicates Under-Nourishment Generally

Mars Occupying the Sixth House Causes Over-Indulgence in Eating

Jupiter in the Sixth is Generally Good for Health Matters, but at Times it Denotes Ill-Health Through Love Feasting

Moon Denotes That the Native Will be Whimsical and Fanciful in the Matter of Eating and Over Fond of Liquids and Spirits, Especially if the Sixth House Happens to Fall in a Watery Sign and it Has Connection with Mars

If Venus is in this Position, the Native Has a Taste for Nice Food and Drinks and May Endanger His Health Through Excess

One Should Not Predict Sickness Without Considering All Other Factors

It is generally accepted that malefics occupying any house can affect the part of the body ruled by that house, particularly if the house is the sixth. However, health will only break down during the periods or sub-periods of planets occupying the sixth house, or the stars of these occupants, or during the periods of planets in conjunction with the lord of the sixth house.

The Sixth House and Work

The sixth house is connected with work and the service rendered by the individual, as well as the exhaustion caused by it. It also denotes the individual's employees, subordinates, or servants, whether they are in the service of the individual or the individual has others as employees. The condition and faithfulness of the individual's inferiors can be ascertained from this house. If benefics are posited in the sixth house, the native may gain from their servants; if malefics are present, then the native may lose through their servants and incur expenses on them that outweigh their income.

The Seventh House and Transactions

The seventh house represents the person with whom the native transacts anything, such as a banker or one who lends or borrows. If the native raises a loan, then the seventh house indicates the banker or lender, and the sixth house, being twelve houses away from the seventh house, denotes that the lender's financial position deteriorates. The sixth house is therefore the house of debt or borrowing. The native will be successful in raising loans if benefics occupy the sixth house or if the sixth house or its lord is connected with benefics in any manner.

Other Connections

This house also governs pet animals and small cattle, domestic creatures, tenants (agricultural tenant or house tenant), enmity, dress and hygiene, sanitation, dietetics, herbs, food and clothing, and the six flavours. Since it is said to be an upachaya sthana, it indicates favourable results in competition or otherwise.

The Sixth House is Also the House of Phenomenal Magic and Superstition: Matters Likely to Bring Worry and Annoyance

According to Uttara Kalamritam, diseases, obstacles in any undertaking, maternal uncles, swellings in the body, insanity, boils, enmity, sickness, miserliness, debt, wounds, mental worry, and intense anguish, incessant eye trouble, receiving aims, untimely meals, trouble and fear from one's dayadins, exertion, service, a severe colic or gout, theft, calamity, prison houses, and cruel actions must also be studied with reference to the sixth house.

In Mundane Astrology, the Sixth House Rules the Working Class, Industries, Sanitation, and Public Health
Vaidyanatha Dikshitar has elucidated in his work "Jataka Parijatam" that diseases, enemies, bad habits, and hurts are to be guessed from the Sixth Bhava.

Sixth House: An Exhaustive Explanation

The sixth house is one that needs explanation, as in one sloka it is condemned as an evil house, whereas the same author takes it as a house that offers beneficial results when occupied by malefics, calling it an upachaya sthana. How to interpret it needs an exhaustive explanation.

The sixth house shows the purchase or sale of conveyance, building, etc. by a younger brother or sister, short journeys of the mother, the bank position and profession of the first issue and their family, loss to the partner or investment or purchases made by the partner, and the secret enemies of the partner or the partner's changes and life in a foreign place or disharmony with or separation from the partner.

If Present:
Indication of Name and Fame, Occupation, and Business of Father in a Chart

It is the house that indicates the name and fame, occupation, and business of the father. If the lords of the 6th and 10th houses form a good aspect and the lord of the 6th house is strong, the native has the same profession as the father.

"The Sixth House is the House of Danger to One's Elder Brother or Friend. Unless the Sixth House is Auspicious, Business People Cannot Have Satisfactory Assistance from the Bank, Customers, etc. For Overdraft Facilities, the Sixth House Must Receive Most Favourable Aspects."

### Seventh House: 
Saptama; Jamittra; Chittottha (Desire); Kama; Dvuna (Love); Madha (Passion); Gamana (Cohabitation); Astna (Setting); Advan (A Way or Road); Marga (Way); Loka (Public); Kalathra (Wife or Husband); Pathni; Pathi; Kalathrasampat (Dowry).

The Seventh House is the "House of Union or Earthy Ties". The Seventh House represents legal bondage. It is through this that one ought to divine about marriage. Although marriage is principally the concern of the Seventh House, it is necessary to consider Houses Two and Eleven also in this respect.

By marriage, it is meant that there is an addition to the family. The second household includes the father, mother, wife, and children, etc.

The Married Partner Brings Permanent Tie of Friendship for Progeny and Pleasure Influenced by the 11th House

Therefore, one has to examine not only the seventh house, but also the houses two and eleven. Houses two, seven, and eleven connected with benefic planets either by association or by aspect denote that the partner in life will come from a respectable family, will be virtuously disposed, and will possess good qualities to enable one to lead a happy and harmonious wedded life.

Besides the life partner, the Seventh House also refers to partners in trade or business and the degree of success achieved through such partnerships. It also indicates all those with whom the native enters into any contract or agreement, those with whom the native is engaged in quarrels and comes into conflict in the open through arguments, litigation, duels, etc., the native's competitor in any undertaking, their rival in any contest, such as in an election, and their public adversaries. In a nutshell, the Seventh House may be said to indicate all those with whom the native transacts or deals in any manner - the engineer or contractor who builds the house for the native or, if the native themselves is an engineer or contractor, the person for whom the native builds; the doctor attending on the native or the patient on whom the native attends if they happen to be a medical practitioner; the person who lends the native money or they who borrow from the native; and so on. Good aspects to the planet in the Seventh House or to the cusp of the Seventh House portray good relationships with the public and favour from them. During the period of the planet in evil aspect, one ought to be careful in undertaking any public activity. This house also denotes whether one will mix up freely in society.

Fines, divorces, legal bonds, agreements, contracts, etc., are other matters ruled by the Seventh House. The Seventh House shows breaks in journeys. The Third House signifies short journeys, and the Ninth House denotes long journeys. The Seventh House indicates visits to various places in one trip.

The Influence of One in Foreign Countries and the Honor and Reputation Achieved There Depends on the Planet in the Seventh House and the Aspect It Receives

Longevity and the Maraka Houses
The first house denotes longevity while the seventh house opposes and is a maraka house, i.e., a danger to longevity. Houses eight, three, and one influence longevity and one has to examine these three houses to determine whether one will be long-lived, or will live up to the middle age, or only up to the adult age, or die in infancy. The twelfth house to any bhava is said to be the negation of that particular bhava, that is to say, it spoils the matters signified by that bhava. Therefore, the houses seven, two, and twelve, which are respectively in twelfth to houses eight, three, and one, prove inimical to longevity and are so termed 'marakasthanas'.

In Prasna or Horary Astrology, this house answers queries relating to the recovery of lost property, describing the thief, pickpockets, etc. The Lagna represents the owner of the stolen property. The fourth Bhava denotes the place of the stolen article. The seventh Bhava shows the thief. The eighth Bhava, being two to the seventh, indicates the thief's wealth. Therefore, when the planet in the seventh or the lord of the seventh is eclipsed or weak, the thief will be caught.

The Lagna Represents One's Routine Life and Permanent Place of Residence; The Seventh House, Opposite to It, Shows Change of Residence. One Should Also Consider the Third House for Change of Residence.

In Mundane or Political Astrology, the Seventh House is considered in matters pertaining to international relationships and arbitration, war and foreign affairs, international trade, the general condition of women, and laws relating to marriage and divorce, public reaction to national policies, public meetings, etc. Westerners call this the House of Open Warfare and Enmity, as well as of Treaties and Alliances.

The Seventh House and Younger Siblings
The seventh house is also regarded as dealing with the native's third brother or sister. The third house from the lagna indicates the first younger brother or sister; the house which is the third to the third shows the second younger brother; the seventh house, which is the third to the fifth house, represents the third younger brother or sister. It is also the house of self-acquisition of the native's servant or employee, being the second house counted from the sixth representing servants. Because the fifth house shows the first child or conception, the seventh, which is the third to the fifth, represents the first child's younger brother or sister or the native's second child; the ninth denotes the third child and so on in this manner.

Being in the fourth house, which indicates the mother, the seventh house deals with the mother's immovable property, vehicle, etc. According to Uttara Kalamritam, the seventh house rules the adopted child. This is understandable, as someone who is issueless may take their younger brother's child in adoption, which is not uncommon.

The Seventh House also denotes the danger of a secret enemy, difficulties, death, etc., being in the Eighth House to the Twelfth House; the religion, long journeys, and higher education of friends or elder brother being the Ninth House reckoned from the Eleventh House; the honour and credit of the Government being in the Tenth House to the Tenth House; associates and friends of the father being the Eleventh House to the Ninth House.

The Native Might Enter into a Partnership with His Father's Friend.

### Eighth House:
Mangalyasthana: Ashta (eight), Ayus (life, longevity), Adhi (mental pain), Parabhava (defeat or insult), Klesha (sorrow), Apavadha (scandal, ill-repute), Marana (death), Asuchi (impurity), Vinga (obstacle, impediment).

The Eighth House and Longevity
The Eighth House is considered to have a direct bearing upon one's longevity or span of life in this world. In considering the question of longevity, it is necessary to take into account the First and Third Houses as well as the Eighth House.

The Eighth House: The House of Death

The eighth house is also called the "house of death" - after having lived the allotted span of life - and all that is related to death such as inheritance, legacies, wills, insurance, gratuity, bonus, etc. The lagna indicates incarnation; the eighth, disincarnation. Hindus consider the eighth house as the end of man's life in this world. marana-sthanas and the lords of the 8th and 3rd houses.

This house conveys whether death is natural or unnatural (e.g. by drowning, fire, accident, or suicide) or due to chronic diseases, and whether it is slow or sudden and violent. The time of death can be inferred with reference to houses 7 and 2, which are 12th and 3rd houses respectively, after judging the bhadaka-sthanas, marana-sthanas, and the lords of the 8th and 3rd houses.

The Effects of the Eighth House on Life

First of all, it should be seen whether the horoscope promises a short, medium, or long life. If the horoscope shows a long life, an evil aspect formed to the 8th house or the planets connected with it by progression or by transit when the native is in his youth will not bring about death. It may cause ill-health, but when the period or sub-period of a beneficial planet showing vitality and immunity follows, the native will fully recover. The 8th house may also denote other disturbing events, such as worry due to a father's hospitalization. The 8th house is the 12th to the 9th house, which represents the father.

When the 8th house is occupied by the lord of the lagna, or the planet in the 8th house is posited in the constellation of the lord of the lagna, or the lord of the 8th house is in conjunction with the lord of the lagna, the indication is that the native himself will be the cause of his own death. If the lord of the 3rd house, occupying the 8th house, is in the constellation of the lord of the 12th house, the native's younger brother or sister may be the cause of death to the native. If the 3rd house alone is connected, the death may happen during travel in a nearby locality. If the 12th house is connected, the death may take place in a nursing home, asylum, sanatorium, or in an unknown place. If the 11th house is connected, one may die in a friend's or elder brother's residence. If the 9th house is in any way connected, it is likely that the native may die in a far-off place or while going on a long journey.

Uranus Connected with the 8th House May Indicate Strange and Sudden Death, Death Caused by Explosion, Death Due to Incurable Diseases, and More. The Disease May Defy Diagnosis and the Native May Die Due to Wrong Treatment. Electrocution and Death by Lightning and Electric Shock Are Also Portended.

Neptune Indicates a Mysterious Death
Death may occur after being in a state of coma or unconsciousness, or due to an overdose of drugs or allergy, etc. Death may also be caused by gas, drowning, poison, etc. If the 8th house falls in a watery sign, death may happen by drowning.

Saturn Gives Liability to Death Due to Colds, Rheumatism, Bone Troubles, and Chronic Diseases, Denoting a Slow and Lingering Death

Jupiter generally gives a peaceful and natural death, but if afflicted by evil aspects from other planets, then death may be due to blood poisoning, cancer, liver trouble, or inflammation of the lungs.

Mars Causes Death Due to Shocks, Accidents, Fire, Epidemics, and Inflammations

Death may occur after a short and sudden attack of illness. If Mars is in a fiery sign at birth and is the significator of death, then the death may be caused by fire, violence, or mechanical instruments. If it is in a watery sign, then the native may drown and die. If Mars is posited in an airy sign, then haemorrhage may be the cause of death.

The Author of Sanketanidhi Calls the Eighth House the House of Mystery and Misery
It has to do with misfortune and mental anxiety, sorrow and strife, worries and privations, delay and dejection, disappointment and defeat, loss and obstruction, blame and ill-repute, accidents, danger from enemies, danger due to diseases, and fear. Impediments and imprisonment, quarrels and fights, and wrong actions also come under the domain of this house. According to Ramadayalu, crossing a river, theft, robbery, siege of a fort, and fighting also come under the domain of this house.

The Financial Status of the Business or Life Partner

The share of profit accruing to the native through the business partner or the dowry or other income derived through a wife or husband is shown by the 8th house. Despite being one of the dushthanas, our wise sages have stated that no house is really evil. Benefics occupying any house improve the matters influenced by that house, while malefics in any house cause destruction to the affairs signified by the bhava occupied. Mahadeva in Jataka Thatva has stated that benefics in the 8th house indicate gain to the partner, meaning that the native may benefit by linking their fortune with another.

The Second House Governs the Native's Self-Acquisition

The Eighth House is Related to the Native's Unearned Wealth or Share of Profit

The Eighth House Also Denotes Surgeons, Medical Officers, Health Inspectors, Slaughter Houses, Butchers, Coroners, and So On

Jupiter or Saturn, the Two Philosophical Planets Occupying the Eighth House, Arouse in the Native a Deep Interest for Occultism and Mystical Subjects

Mercury, the Planet of Pure Intellect in This Position, Denotes an Enquiring Mind Concerning Occult Matters, and One May Be Inclined to Study Hidden and Metaphysical Problems.

In Questions Relating to Nation, the Eighth House Deals with Public Mortality, the Death Rate, Suicide, Serious Accidents, Infection, Flood, Fire, Famine, Disease, Earthquake, National Calamity or Gv:ef, Financial Relations with Foreign Countries, the Nation's Exports and Imports, Debts Due from Foreign Countries, Surrender or Loss of Territory to Another Country, Public Loans, Debts and Interest Rates, Deficit Budget, Estate Duties, and Public Sales.

In Horary Astrology, This House Must Be Referred To for Information Relating to Crossing of Rivers, Difficulties of Journey, Impenetrable Sufferings Caused by Enemies, Death, Corruption, Fight, Disease, and Vulnerable or Weak Points (Prasnagnana).

The Fourth House, according to Uttara Kalamritam, rules over hereditary property. The Fourth House is the Eighth House to the Ninth, denoting the father. Normally, the father's ancestral or unearned property passes on to the son after the father's death. Additionally, the Eighth House is the Twelfth House to the Ninth House. The father may make investments which, after his death, accrue to the native.
It is the Fifth House to the Fourth, indicating the mother. The mother may gain through lottery, prize bond, or speculation if benefics are in the Eighth House. The ninth house is also known as the house of 'Acharva' (guru or preceptor) and 'Pithru' (father). It is also associated with 'Subham' (auspiciousness), 'Pooja' (worship), 'Tapas' (penance), 'Dharma' (virtue), 'Pauthra' (grandson), 'Japa' (prayer) and 'Daiva Upasana' (spiritual inflation). It is also associated with 'Arya Vamsa' (noble family).

### Ninth House
The ninth house is associated with faith, wisdom, and divine worship. It is considered to be an auspicious house, as it shows one's fortune in the present life as a result of past actions. Luck being closely linked to merit, one will only reap the fruits of the acts done in the previous birth. Therefore, a look at the ninth house would enable one to know what 'bhagya' (fortune and prosperity) one has accumulated as a result of the meritorious deeds done in the previous birth. The ninth house is also known as the house of 'Acharva' (guru or preceptor) and 'Pithru' (father). It is associated with 'Subham' (auspiciousness), 'Pooja' (worship), 'Tapas' (penance), 'Dharma' (virtue), 'Pauthra' (grandson), 'Japa' (prayer) and 'Daiva Upasana' (spiritual inflation). It is also associated with 'Arya Vamsa' (noble family).

Since the Ninth House Rules Philosophy, Religious and Philosophical Beliefs

If Jupiter, the philosophical planet, is in the Ninth House and well-aspected, the native may be religious, devoted, orthodox, and kind-hearted. Even Saturn in this position receiving favourable aspects makes one deeply religious, methodical, and meditative. Jupiter or Saturn receiving good aspects from the Sun or Mercury gives one intuition and forethought. He will be much esteemed in religious circles and will occupy coveted positions in religious and philanthropic institutions. However, if these planets are adversely aspected, one is liable to go to extremes in religious and other matters.

All matters concerning temples, churches, mosques, and other religious institutions, including those devoted to promoting people's spiritual welfare, should be ascertained from this house. Hindus attribute pilgrimage to holy places, wells, circular reservoirs, sacrifices, and charity to the 9th house.

The Third House is the House of Perception and Learning, while the Ninth House is the House of Intuition and Pure Reason. If the Third House is concerned with ordinary mental inclinations, the Ninth House is concerned with higher education, higher knowledge, and higher thought. The degree of knowledge one may develop - whether collegiate, academic, philosophical, religious, literary, artistic, or scientific - can be deduced from this House. The Ninth House presides over research, invention, discovery, exploration, and submission of theses. religion, long journeys, higher education, philosophy, etc.

Hindus attribute the 9th house to the father because the ninth sign of the zodiac, Dhanus (Sagittarius), is ruled by 'Guru' the Preceptor and spiritual teacher. In ancient times, the father was invariably the spiritual preceptor or guru of the children to whom he would initiate Brahma Upadesam and transmit his siddhis or psychic powers. Counting the 9th house as the first, we find that the fifth therefrom indicates the native. Some persons advocate the fourth house and the tenth house for the father, but this is incorrect. Always take the 9th house for the father. To this house is ascribed law, legal arbitration, religion, long journeys, higher education, philosophy, etc.

Spiritual Initiation, Teaching, and Everything Connected to It

Probably because the ninth sign of the zodiac is owned by the wise Jupiter, Hindus term the ninth as the house of dharma or virtue and of an occult and metaphysical mind. Dreams and visions come under the purview of this house, as well as communications with spirits and the like. Neptune, the planet of dreams, in the ninth denotes peculiar dreams.

The Third and Ninth Houses Indicate Change or Journey Away from Permanent Residence
The Third House denotes short travels; the Ninth, representing the wider mind, is related to long journeys, sea voyages, air travel, etc. It determines the amount of travel in far-off places or countries and the success achieved there. Strangers and foreigners, as well as their relations, come under the influence of this house.

The Ninth House Governs Publishing

The ninth house governs publishing, especially volumes of intrinsic value, particularly those relating to religion, science, law, philosophy, travel, and international affairs. This is in contrast to the third house, which relates to lighter reading, news, and matters of ephemeral nature. To gain insight into one's success in such matters, one should examine the ninth house. Yuga, the ninth house was the abode of Dharma.

Association with good people, reverence and devotion to God and elders, the medicine most constitutionally suited, previous birth and punya, and the blessings received from the family deity should be divined from this house. Providential help is due to the occupation of benefic planets in the ninth bhava, or because the ninth lord is favourably placed. In Satya Yuga, the ninth house was the abode of Dharma.

Samhita, the author, says that matters relating to rest houses and favours from others should be investigated from the Ninth House in State Astrology. The Ninth House relates to all forms of long distance travel and communications, such as sea voyages, air and land travel, legal departments, judges, matters relating to religion, temples, churches, religious and philosophical thought in the nation, science, text-book publishing, universities and those connected with them, emigration and immigration, import and export of the nation, national trade and commerce, short-wave radio and long distance communications, cables and wireless.

Kalidasa states that one should judge the following matters from the Ninth House: charity, virtue, visits to holy places, association with good people, Vedic sacrifice, good conduct, purity of mind, reverence to elders, penance, medicinal drugs, one's policy, God worship, acquisition of higher learning, dignity, mythology, moral study, long travel, ancestral property, horses, elephants and buffaloes (connected with religious purposes), coronation hall and circulation of money.

Bhattotpala in Prasnagnana states that wells, lakes, tanks, water-sheds, temples, monetary vows, pilgrimage and meritorious deeds should be judged with reference to the Ninth House.

The Ninth House governs short travels of the wife or husband of the business partner, which is the third reckoned from the Seventh House; the servant's vehicle and landed property, which is the fourth from the Sixth House; the child's speculative benefits and pleasures, which is the fifth to the Fifth House; the mother's illness, her servants, etc., which is the sixth to the Fourth House; the younger brother's wife or the younger sister's husband or their competitors, rivals, etc., which is the seventh counted from the Third House. It is the house of friends to the elder brother and indicates the elder brother's accomplishments, which is the ninth to the Tenth House.

### Tenth House:
The applications applied to the 10th bhava are: Madhya; Meshurana; Jeevana (livelihood); Rajaspadada (kingdom); Sat (good); Kriya (work); Vyapara (commerce, trade, business); Jaya (success); ASpada (rank or position); Achara (good conduct); Mana (honour); Kriyam (sacrifice); Agya; Ajna (command); Guna (quality); Artha (wealth); Gamana (gait); Gnana (wisdom); Pravrithi (inclination); Karma (occupation).

The Midheaven, or angle of the south, whose line or cusp the Sun touches at midday at every place on the Earth, is termed the Medium Coeli or the 10th house. Hence, it is the chief or supreme angle of the heavens. In astronomical calculations, the 10th house is a principal feature, as all arcs of directions to the angles are measured from the Right Ascension of the Midheaven. In astrological predictions, it is the most important, being related to all matters affecting one's name, fame, honour, and recognition.

Both Western and Hindu astrologers agree that planets are very powerful when they occupy any of the houses 1, 4, 7, or 10. These four houses are known as angular or kendra houses in the horoscope and are considered to yield great strength. Planets occupying any of these are said to have full expression power to do what they indicate by nature as well as by lordship of houses in the chart. 
Houses 2, 5, 8, and 11 are called succedent or panaphara houses and planets therein are not as powerful as those in angular or kendra houses, but possess moderate strength. The weakest of all in influence are the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th houses, termed cadent or apoklima houses. A planet placed in a cadent house is supposed to have the least expressive power. 
One may, for instance, lack suitable opportunities at needed times, no matter what their merit or skill. 
The angular, succedent, and cadent houses respectively correspond to movable, fixed, and common signs of the zodiac in power and influence.

The 10th House: Lordship, Honour, Dignity, and Public Esteem

The 10th house is described as the house of lordship, honour, dignity, and public esteem. It is aptly called the apex of the horoscope, since it denotes man's worldly attainments achieved through name and fame, power and prestige, credit and conduct, success and status, rank and renown, respect and reputation, and ambition and authority. One's public life and popularity, his worldly standing in terms of material responsibility, and his connection with people in high positions should be judged from an examination of the strength of the 10th house, the occupants of the 10th house and those in their constellations (nakshathra), the lord of the 10th house and those in his constellations, and the planets conjoined with the 10th lord and those aspecting the 10th house. All questions concerning one's worldly activities and moral responsibilities are determined with reference to this house.

The 10th House Presides Over Preferment or One's Inclination for Permanency, Promotion, Advancement, and Appointment, Etc.

It Shows How One Acquires Superiority or Affluence - Whether by Being Engaged in Independent Pursuits or Business or in Professional Service, or by Occupying an Exalted Elective Office or Appointment.

The Influence of the 10th House
The chief influence of the 10th house is profession, occupation, or business. One cannot arrive at a judgement in regard to what pursuits one will follow from an examination of the 10th house alone. In this aspect, houses 2, 6, and 10 have to be investigated and studied together. These three houses are called the material trinity of houses, principally because they correspond to the 2nd, 6th, and 10th signs of the zodiac which are earthy signs representing material gains.

In day-to-day life, it is not unusual to find people who follow avocations for which they have neither the requisite aptitude nor the qualification required (indeed, people have no choice in choosing their vocation). There are others who change their occupation several times, and some others carry on two or more different lines of activity at the same time. In the vast majority of cases, one is forced to take to a particular vocation not because of any interest in it or any particular liking, but solely for monetary gain. Mantreswara in Phaladeepika fittingly uses the expression "Pravritti" in connection with the 10th house. Therefore, the 10th house may be taken as designating one's preferment in this respect for improvement. The 6th house shows service, routine monotonous work, and drudgery carried on by one under force of circumstances, whether he likes it or not. The 2nd house indicates the outcome of one's labour in monetary advantage: self-acquisition.

If Neptune Occupies the 10th House with Good Aspect from Other Planets

The native will fit well in occupations where secrecy, mystery, and inspiration are employed, such as secret service, inspirational writing, singing, music, art, etc. Neptune is called the Sea God, so one may have connections with sea and related industries. When Neptune in the 10th house is well-dignified, it portrays a highly inspirational nature, making the native capable of attaining honour and position through some unique achievement. It also threatens danger to the life of one of the parents. Unfavourable aspects to Neptune denote disgrace, discredit, and scandal, deserved or otherwise.

Uranus is said to be independent, erratic, eccentric, unconventional, and original by nature. If it is posited in the tenth house and is aspected well, one will originate new plans of work and follow uncommon pursuits, and come out successful. If Mercury indicates talent, Uranus denotes genius. Many inventors, reformers, explorers, astrologers, and great scientists are born with Uranus in the tenth house. Uranus rules suddenness, so sudden changes in occupation are indicated. Being bold, independent, and changeful, one invites opposition from the public and government bodies. Uranus afflicted denotes discredit and reverses, and extraordinary experiences in public or professional affairs.

The Slow and Sluggish Saturn, Well Dignified by Sign Position and Favourably Aspected, Causes One to Rise by Slow, Steady, and Patient Industry. There is, However, Liability to Interruption and Delay. Unless Saturn is Strong by Sign and Aspect, It Inclines to a Subordinate Position Generally. Affliction to Saturn Brings Public Discredit. The Native May Possess Merit but Lacks Opportunities and Encounters Impediments in Business. Disappointments in Professional Matters are Denoted Especially When Saturn's Period or Sub-Period is in Operation. Good and Bad Aspects to Saturn Show a Good Rise and Sudden Fall.

The Benevolent Jupiter Connected to the 10th House

The benevolent Jupiter being well connected to the 10th house is a definite indication of high honours and favour from those in high positions. Jupiter being the planet of justice and high morals, one's moral standard will be high and they will earn through right means. This is a very good testimony for political, social, and financial success. Depending on other considerations, it denotes positions such as judges, trustees, ministers, ambassadors, philosophers, stock brokers, bankers, merchants, etc. It includes all positions of distinction, trust, and responsibility. If afflicted, one may occupy subordinate positions in banks, courts, etc., or serve as a cashier.

The militant Mars, well dignified with good aspects, gives one energy and enterprise, force and courage, and good executive ability. One will be well qualified to captain any industry or conduct any business, especially if Mars is in a movable sign. The native succeeds best in martial occupations where fire, iron, or sharp tools are used in a skilled manner. Mars, being the planet of inexhaustible energy and enterprise, will, if well fortified, make the native fit for lines where courage or daring is necessary, or where skill is combined with muscular energy. If Mars is afflicted, one will exhibit excessive ambition, authority, arrogance, and aggressiveness, and will invite opposition and incur disfavour.

If the mutable planet Mercury is in 10th house of success in commission business or agencies and trading, one may expect success. All mental and occult occupations will be fruitful. Mercury points to plurality, so one may engage in several occupations at a time. One may be a rolling stone, changing occupations often. Generally, one succeeds in a subordinate capacity, as Mercury is a messenger and not a master. One may be employed in engineering, postal communication, export, import, or international trade, or be connected with any of these as a contractor or supplier.

The Passive and Peaceful Venus, Placed in the 10th with Good Aspect from Other Planets

The passive and peaceful Venus, placed in the 10th house with good aspects from other planets, is a sure indication of good will and patronage among ladies and success in social, artistic, or musical pursuits. Popularity is acquired more by an affable and good-humoured nature than by merit. Venus has sway over those occupations which deal with artistic, refined, and entertainment matters, and with all those businesses where women's needs are catered for. Success in such professions or occupations is a certainty.

The Dignified Sun: Unafflicted by Any
The sun is the surest sign of success, honour, distinction, authority, power, prosperity, high patronage, and public support. It assures success in governmental circles, and one's credit is secure and success is steady in whatever profession, occupation, or business they may be engaged in. Through the favour of superiors, one will rise and occupy positions of trust and responsibility. They will be esteemed by the community and honoured by election to a high public office.

The sun is a dependable planet, and one can depend upon it to justify the confidence reposed in them. One will be honest and upright in dealings and possess a good moral standard. The sun rules, among other things, over security of service, medicine, and government. If afflicted, one may be pompous and vainglorious, may exhibit wealth of power, and find difficulty in enlisting favour.

The Inconstant Moon: Its Influence on Public Life
The inconstant Moon is said to rule the general public, and so its position in the 10th house is a favourable indication for public life. However, due to the Moon's changeable nature, several changes in public life are also shown. If it is aspected well, it brings the person prominently before the public and ensures their favour, but popularity is generally unstable. There is a liability to fluctuation in business, occupation, or profession.

The Moon indicates changes and voyages, and so one may have many changes in connection with their profession, etc., or be engaged in professions or occupations which demand travelling about, especially if the Moon is in a movable sign. The Moon also rules public commodities, shipping, travelling, and affairs connected with common people and women. If it is aspected well, it denotes success in professions concerning these.

If afflicted, public scandal and censure cannot be ruled out.

The Tenth House: Karmasthana
The tenth house is termed 'karmasthana'. It includes doing the last rites to one's parents, performing religious functions, such as yagnas, and making money through work. It is sometimes a coincidence that, at the very time when one gets an advancement, they also lose either of their parents. The tenth house is the second to the ninth house, which denotes the father, and the seventh house to the fourth, which indicates the mother. Houses two and seven are marakasthanas, or death-inflicting houses, so it is not unusual that during the period or sub-period of the planets connected with the tenth house, one advances in business, profession, or occupation, and at the same time loses one of their parents.

The 10th house has reference to the employer, superior, master in trade or profession, judge, and the government. Being the 2nd house to the 9th, which represents the father, it is said to govern patrimony or one's inheritance. The 8th house suggests one's unearned income, and the 4th house is the 8th to the 9th, representing the father. Hindus refer to the 4th house for hereditary income which descends to one from ancestors. By reflection, the 10th house also governs these. The 10th house is called 'Agya' and rules orders or commands issued. The 9th house governs long journeys, while the 10th is related to pilgrimage to holy places.

In Uttara Kalamritam, Kalidasa elucidates that all information regarding trade, prosperity, honour from Government, honourable living, permanence, pre-eminence, seal of authority, horse riding, athletics, service, sacrifice, agriculture, doctor, name, fame, depositing a treasure, talisman, morality, medicine, thigh, prosperity, adopted son, teaching, intellect to command, and mantras should be sought through the 10th bhava. The author of Jatakadesamarga avers that it is through the 10th house that one ought to divine about one's honour, profession, dignity, position, or rank.

Bhattotpala Declares in Prasnagnana that the Tenth House Should be Examined for Matters Concerning Kingdom, Seal of Authority, Great Religious Merit, Position, Utility, and Rain, and Other Things Pertaining to the Sky
Vaidyanatha Dikshitar Mentions that One Will Gain Authority, Honourable Rank, Ornaments, Apparel, Activities, Agriculture, Retirement from the World, Beneficent Acts Sanctioned in the Scriptures, Means of Livelihood, Fame, Knowledge of the Special Arts and Learning Generally from the Tenth Bhava, Its Owner, the Sun, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn
Ramadayulu in Sanketanidhi Opines that One's Occupation, Family, Happiness, etc., Should be Deduced from a Look at the Tenth House. He Further Says that One's Meritorious Deeds, Trade, Occupation, Livelihood, Administrative Appointment, Happiness, Position, Action, and Sraddhas to Ancestors are to be Ascertained from This House. According to Him, the Two Knees and the Backbone of a Person are Governed by the Tenth House.
In Satya Samhita, the Author Inclines to the View that the Tenth House Has to be Examined in Order to Find Out One's Worldly Standing, Rank, and Eminence, as Well as Association with Virtuous People.
Prityusas, Son of Varahamihira, Asserts that All Information Pertaining to One's Occupation and Living, and All About One's Valour, Prowess, Learning, and Fame, and All Seen and Heard About a Person are to be Ascertained Through This House.

In Horary Questions, This House Concerns the Judges, Judgment, and the Substances Taken Away by the Thieves (Being the Fourth to the Seventh Denoting the Thief)
The Tenth House Stands for the Stewards and Their President in the Race Clubs, the Aristocracy of the Owners of the Horses, and the Trainers.

In mundane and political astrology, the 10th house deals with government in a general sense, its affairs, and its chief executive. It signifies the head of the state, whether monarch or president, as well as royalty, the party in office, the national leaders, the upper strata of society, those in authority, eminent and distinguished persons, and the aristocracy. It governs national trade, the nation's honour, integrity, credit, power, and status among the community of nations. This house provides a clue to guess the political situation prevailing in the country at any time.
The 10th house signifies the father's self-acquisition, being the second reckoned from the 9th. It is also the maraka house to both the father and mother; to the father, because it is in the 2nd to the 9th, and to the mother because it is in the 7th to the 4th. Being the fourth counted from the 7th house, it shows the permanent possessions or conveyance of the business or married partner. It rules the speculative and pleasurable pursuits of servants and their children, being the fifth from the 6th denoting servants. As the 10th house happens to be the 6th house taking the 5th as the first, it portrays ill-health to children or the debts incurred by them. Since it is the 7th to the 4th, it refers to the mother's opponents in litigation, election, etc. Danger to the younger brother or sister, their legacies, etc., are described by the 10th house which is the 8th house counted from the 3rd. It is the house of loss and secret inimical activities to one's elder brother or one's dear friends and their hospitalization.

### Eleventh House
The terms used to refer to the 11th bhava are: Ekadasa; Labha (profit or gain); Aya (income or all kinds of receipts); Agamana (acquisition); Apti (gain); Prapthi (what is unto one); Kama (desire, passion); Siddhi (fulfilment of one's desire); Vibhava (wealth or riches); Slaghyata (veneration, commendation); Sarasa (anything juicy or succulent).
Both the oriental and occidental astrologers are unanimous in describing the 11th house as the house of friends. It stands for all those who are allied to the native by likeness or sympathy of interest in society, community, etc. It includes one's favourites, flatterers, admirers, associates, advisers, adherents, supporters, well-wishers and close acquaintances (casual acquaintance is shown by the third house). Therefore, it is necessary to fix attention on the 11th bhava to find out the sort of friends one will acquire.
Houses 9, 10, 11 and 12 are termed Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha houses. "Kama" should not be construed to mean only passion. It also shows desire. 'Siddhi' signifies fulfilment. From the 11th house should be resolved all questions concerning one's hopes, wishes and aspirations and their realisation. The 11th house governs success in all undertakings, whether it be in profession or business, higher studies or foreign collaboration, election, litigation, speculation, writings, health, etc. Suppose one is engaged in litigation at the time when he is running the conjoined periods of the planets favourably connected to the 11th house. He will then come out successful, mostly by compromise, even though his case may be weak, as the 11th house stands for lasting friendship and gains.

The 11th House: Profit or Gain

The 11th house is most commonly referred to as 'Labhasthana', denoting profit or gain. It is through this house that every accumulation of incoming wealth is to be expected. One may earn by one's own exertion, which is indicated by the lagna. Self-acquisition is determined by the 2nd house. Earnings through short writings, agency, writings, younger brother, etc., are shown by the 3rd house. Money received through mother, vehicles, immovable property, treasure, etc., is described by the 4th. Gains in speculation, sports, lottery, amusement interests like cinema, drama, etc., and through children are governed by the 5th house. The 6th house denotes income through service, pet animals, or by borrowing. Income accruing to one through business partnerships, wife or husband, litigation, etc., is indicated by the 7th house. The 8th house has to do with insurance, provident fund, wills, legacies, etc. One may derive monetary advantage through foreign collaboration, contact with strangers, father, or by doing research, which is the influence of the 9th house. Lastly, one's income through profession, business, or inheritance is indicated by the 10th house. The 12th house of a horoscope shows all expenses, investments, and withdrawal of money from the bank. Therefore, houses 1 to 10 put together describe the various sources of one's income; the 12th house deals with expenses. Adding the income resulting from houses 1 to 10 and deducting the expenses indicated by the 12th house, one gets the net balance called profit. This is what is shown by the 11th house.

If one has lent money to someone, then the principal and interest are ruled by the eleventh house. On the other hand, if one has borrowed, then the fifth house deals with the discharge of debt. Why? Because the fifth house is the eleventh house counted from the seventh house, which denotes the person from whom the money has been borrowed.

So, good aspects to the significators connected with the 11th house signify the return of capital and interest by the person who has taken money on loan, and, on the same analogy, favourable aspects to the planets beneficially connected to the 5th house connote that the native will pay back the amount taken on loan, together with interest thereon.
The 11th house presides over many things, including pleasure, prosperity, profit, progress in attempts, peace after achieving aspirations, partnership, and permanent ties of friendship. This house also denotes the desire for reunion, so one must investigate this house to determine what kind of emotional attachments one will have. In fact, the 11th house is more accurate in determining a lover than the 7th house, as it stands for lasting friendship and intimacy that may lead to marriage. One may also live with pleasure with a member of the opposite sex without actually getting married. The 7th house shows to whom one is bound by legal ties, not necessarily a lasting friendship. If the significators connected to the 7th house and 11th house are favorably disposed, one may be successful in marriage. In matters concerning marriage, the 11th house should also be taken into account along with houses 2 and 7.

Investigating the 11th house can help one ascertain how successful they will be in social and financial matters. This house reflects the native's attitude towards society and their interest in group advantage rather than personal aims and ambitions. It also relates to reformative and unconventional activities.

Another Important Feature of the 11th House: Progeny or Rearing of Children

The 5th house chiefly deals with children, and by reflex action, the 11th house, which is the opposite of the 5th, is connected. Ramadayalu in Sanketanidhi provides support for this interpretation when he says that any bhava and its 7th will always have similar aims to be carried out. He clearly elucidates in Sloka 106 that the good or bad effects from the 11th house will be the same as the effects of the planets posited in the 5th and vice versa. Not only this, the 11th also happens to be the 5th counted from the 7th ruling the married partner.

The 11th House Governs Elder Brother or Sister
All information in this respect is indicated by the 11th House. Attention should be paid to the 11th House, the planets connected with it, its lord, etc., and judgement should be made accordingly.

The Eleventh House Indicates "Trusts". It Also Denotes the Financial Affairs of the Employer or Those in Command Over the Native, Being the Second to Tenth House.

In the physical body, it has domain over the left car, the right foot, the left hand, and the two shanks.

Vaidyanatha Dikshita suggests that one should look to the eleventh house to find out the accumulation of incoming wealth. He emphatically declares that the planet occupying the eleventh house, when strong, is capable of bringing prosperity and wealth.

Varahamihira refers to this house as "Aya," denoting one's income. He avers that the 11th house is one of the improving houses, or upachayasthanas. The sages say that even malefics placed in upachaya houses (3, 6, 10, and 11) prove auspicious and bring profit and pleasure.

Mahadeva in Jataka Tatva Calls the 11th House 'Labhasthana'

Mahadeva in Jataka Tatva calls the 11th house "Labhasthana". It indicates gains which accrue to a person, the nature of such gain being dependent on the nature of the planet connected. If it is a benefit, one will acquire wealth by fair means and by pursuit of right actions. If the planet therein be a malefic, one may earn by unfair means even. If the planets connected are both malefic and benefic, then in their respective periods or sub-periods one will resort to foul or fair methods, as the case may be, to attain one's objectives. Mahadeva also feels that the 11th house has to be seen to determine the type of vehicles one will have.

Kalidasa Mentions in Uttara Kalamritam the Following to be Deduced from the 11th House

Realisation of one's wishes and desires; acquisition of wealth, profit in every undertaking; varieties of income; one's influence, dependency, eldest brother, paternal uncle, undesirable nature (if afflicted); worship of deities and of the virtuous; devotion to God; respect to elders; gain of knowledge (10th stands for jnana; 11th is the 2nd from the 10th); high level of intelligence; the welfare of the employer; loss of interest on one's capital; possession of costly metals, ornaments, etc.; advising others; luck; easy gains; brother-in-law; mother's longevity (8th to the 4th house); left ear; the knee; attractive painting and arts; sarasa (juicy articles); hearing some pleasing and delightful music or happy news; ministership; dawn of fortune; and longevity.

In the Jataka Chandrika, it has been declared that the 11th house is the bhadhakasthana for persons born in movable signs (char rasis). For those whose births have fixed signs (sthira rasis) ascending, the 9th house is the bhadhakasthana and for those born with common signs (ubhayas rasi) in their Ascendant, the 7th house is the bhadhakasthana. For all natives, the 7th and 2nd houses are marakasthanas or death-inflicting houses, being respectively in 12th to the 8th house representing longevity and in opposition to the 1st and 8th houses. One should not go by the literal meaning of the 'bhadhakasthana' and conclude that it is evil in every respect. 'Bhadhakasthana' applies only to longevity and health. It has to be understood that during the period or sub period of the planet owning the bhadhakasthana or of the planet connected with the bhadhakasthana, whichever is the stronger of the two, one may suffer from ill-health or there may be anxiety in regard to one's health. If, according to the indications at birth, one is destined to live long, one will survive the period or sub period of the planets connected with the bhadhakasthana and only enjoy the beneficial results related to the 11th house. If one has lived the allotted span of life and their death is drawing near, the planets in the bhadhakasthana or its lord will operate at that time to put an end to life.

Ramadayalu in Sankethanidhi, when discussing the 11th house, makes it clear that all matters pertaining to the right foot, left hand, one's knowledge, income, wealth, good actions, horses, elephants, vehicles, chariots, furniture, ornaments, clothing, swinging cradles, beauty, festivity, decoration, etc., are to be ascertained from this bhava. He adds that a respectful offering, sovereign, money, daughters, friends, cattle, and good effects come under the purview of the 11th bhava.

The Author of the Jatakadesamarga Expresses the Opinion that Attainment of Efforts, Desire, and the Absence of Misery Can Be Predicted Through the 11th Bhava.

Bhattotpala ascribes elephant riding, horse riding, elephants, horses, and conveyances, clothing, crops, jewels, wisdom, and wealth to the 11th bhava and says that one should infer all information about these from it.

Sun in 11: An Indication of Lofty Actions and Desires

This is an indication of lofty actions and desires, and success in realizing them. One may associate with men in power and high positions who will remain firm, honorable, and steadfast in friendship. The native is sure to reap immense benefit through them. It is a good position for social success, provided other testimonies lend support.

Jupiter in this House Shows That One's Friends Will Be Wealthy, Virtuous, True, and Influential, Rendering All Assistance

Social success, popularity, and credit will be secured through friendship. One's ambitions will be achieved and hopes realized in full. Jupiter's situation here with good aspects from others connotes social, financial, and political success. If Jupiter is afflicted, then the friends may be sincere in their desire to help but will lack the ability to fulfill it, or they may serve their own interests by such friendship.

Mercury in 11th House Draws Many Acquaintances Among Literary and Scientific Minded People

Mercury being mutable by nature, none of them will be sufficiently steadfast in their affections, unless Mercury is well-aspected. If afflicted, one should not place any reliance on friends for assistance nor should they stand surety to them.

Moon in 11, Receiving Harmonious Aspects

The Moon in the 11th house, receiving harmonious aspects, shows a large circle of friends, especially among the female folk, patronage of women, and social success and popularity. The Moon is changeable by nature, so one will have few lasting attachments unless the Moon was well aspected at birth by planets in fixed signs or the Moon itself was in a fixed sign. If afflicted, those extending their hand of friendship will do so with the ulterior motive of deriving benefits from the native.

Saturn in the 11th House, Well Dignified by Occupation and Aspect

Saturn in the 11th house, well dignified by occupation and aspect, attracts aged and serious friends. One may contract friendship with those in subordinate positions. Saturn shows constriction; Jupiter, expansion. Therefore, Saturn in the 11th house shows few friends while Jupiter indicates a large number of friends. If Saturn is afflicted, one should be careful with aged people who would make use of the native for selfish ends and desert them when they are no longer of any use to them.

Saturn is a planet of limitation and restriction and its position in the 11th house does not augur well; for it portrays delay in the achievement of ambitions even when well aspected. When one follows the dasa bhukti system, the beneficial Saturn will give the favourable results in its sub-period and Saturn will not allow other planets to offer such results in their sub-periods which precede Saturn.

Mars in Eleventh House Brings Friends Among the Martial and Athletic Class
If well dignified, one works courageously and enthusiastically to realize their desires, leaving no stone unturned until success is sure. If afflicted, it makes one touchy and sensitive towards their friends. Mars is an ambitious planet and if afflicted, one is likely to overreach themselves in their desires and suffer consequently. If Mars is afflicted, it causes impulsiveness and rashness, thereby denoting disagreement with friends. If Saturn or Mercury afflict, violation of friendship and treachery is indicated. If the Sun, Jupiter, or Mercury aspect unfavorably, friends may offer wrong advice, landing one in trouble. If Venus or the Moon afflict, it indicates overindulgence with friends, especially female companions.

Venus in the 11th House, favourably aspected, portrays friendship with those of the opposite sex and those in social circles who will be ever ready to assist one in realizing their desires. One's friends may be humane and sympathetically and artistically inclined. This position of Venus favours a fruitful marriage. The 11th House shows fondness for society and Venus is said to be a social planet, so its situation here is conducive to success in social affairs. Afflictions to Venus often show that one's friends may prove to be ambitious and time-serving, and throw the native aside when opportunity offers.

Uranus in the 11th house is a strong influence that can bring about strange, sudden, and remarkable friendships. One will associate with those who are original, creative, or inventive, who can prove immensely helpful to the native if Uranus was well aspected at birth. As Uranus is a progressive planet, one's hopes will be progressive and peculiar. If affliction occurs, friends can suddenly turn out to be foes.

Neptune in 11, Well Aspected

If Neptune is well aspected in the 11th house, it gives a person high spiritual aspirations and will gift them with the ability to attract other people of a similar nature who may aid them in realizing their ambitions. If Neptune is afflicted, then those who pose as friends may prove deceptive and treacherous. Those with this position of Neptune afflicted should be careful when cultivating friendships.

In Political Astrology, the 11th House is said to indicate Parliament or equivalent legislative branches in other governments. It rules the Lok Sabha, the Lower House of State Assemblies, Corporations, Municipal Bodies, District Boards, Panchayats, and similar legislative bodies. It also bears relation to parties, legislation, governmental policies, and planning. It is related to international friendships and the exchange of amenities among nations. It deals with companies, stores, governing bodies, associations, etc., and all institutions where group-interest is involved. It represents the wealth and money of the "exchequer" or the government, as well as the friends and allies of the nation.

In Horse Racing, it denotes the management of the committee under the control of the Stewards. The number of the winner is shown by this House.

In Market Forecasting, This House is Taken for Government Loans for Electric Companies, Gas, Museums, Agriculture, Estates, Irrigation, Silk, etc.

11th House in Horary Astrology
In horary astrology, as in natal astrology, the 11th house is connected with hopes and desires and their fulfilment. If the 11th house is afflicted, the querist will suffer severe disappointment in the matter examined.

Being the 2nd from the 10th, it shows the financial gain derived from occupation. It rules over father's short journeys, gain through correspondence, editing, publishing, his younger brother or sister, etc. Being the 3rd counted from the 9th, it indicates the termination of a will or legacy. The 11th house concerns the birth of children, being the 5th from the 7th; it also shows partner's pleasurable pursuits, speculation, etc. It shows recovery from ill-health and victory over enemies, being the 6th reckoned from the 6th, which represents ill-health, enemies, and debts. As it is the 7th house from the 5th, it signifies the daughter-in-law, the children's competitors in examinations, etc. Being the 8th to the 4th, it stands for danger, difficulties, disappointment, and even death of the mother. To the younger brother or sister represented by the 3rd, it is the 9th house and hence is related to her/his long journeys in connection with education, etc. It is the house of success to the elder brother or sister if well fortified. It also signifies freedom from misery and pain and discharge from hospital, being in 12th to the 12th house.

### Twelfth House
The expressions ascribed to the 12th bhava are: Anthyabha (last house); Rippha; Lopasthana (house of disappearance); Bandha (bondage); Vigama Vyaya (loss, negation); Sayana (bed); Papa (sin); Daridrya (poverty, penury); Suchaha (tale bearer, backbiter); Kshaya (loss, decline); Dukkha (misery); Vama Nayana (left eye); Anghri (leg).

According to our ancients, the first eight houses of the horoscope indicate 'Ikaloka Sukham' or worldly pleasures and pains, while the last four, namely houses 9, 10, 11 and 12, denote 'Para Loka Sadhanam' or spiritual welfare. These last four houses are accordingly called Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha houses. The 12th house rules man's final emancipation from the chain of births and deaths, and his merger with the Cosmic Soul. Divine worship and the future state of existence are determined from the 12th bhava.

The 12th House Shows Loss, Impediments, Restraint, Limitation, Waste, and Extravagance; Expenses Outweighing Income, Drudgery, and Deception
Hindu sages have averred that the ownership of houses 6, 8, and 12, which are termed "Dus Sthanas," is productive of evil. No house is unfortunate or evil, unless afflicted, and this is true of the 12th house too.

Each house holds sway over certain distinct affairs, and when it is afflicted, one cannot expect the matters signified by it to manifest fully. Such contrary results will only be experienced when the native runs the period or sub-period of the planet afflicting the house under consideration, on the days, nakshatras, and lagnas ruled by it, and not otherwise. When the period or sub-period of the planet which is beneficially connected to the house under consideration follows, there is bound to be an improvement in the matters denoted by that house.

R.C. Smith, popularly known as the first Raphael, emphatically declares that evil planets in the twelfth house are far less evil than when angular.

The 12th House Deals with Loss, Expenses, Purchases, Investments, Donations, Charity, and Association with Philanthropic Institutions
For instance, one may purchase costly jewels if the planet connected has anything to do with the 2nd house, or incur expenses in connection with short journeys or writings and publications if the third house is connected. He may invest his money on landed or immovable property or go in for a vehicle when the 12th house will be connected. Also, he may be forced to spend on his mother going on a long travel, the 12th house being the 9th from the 4th house. One may speculate and lose or take up an insurance policy for his children's education or marriage and may be paying premiums if the 5th house has any relation. Therefore, there are various sources through which one may spend.

If One Has Borrowed, the 12th House Indicates Repayment of Loan
In Uttra Kalamritam, it has been said that the 12th house has to be investigated for repayment of loan. Discharge of loan is to be determined not only from the 12th house, but also from the 8th house. The 6th house indicates borrowing in the native's horoscope and the 7th house indicates the person who lends. The 6th house is the 12th to the person who has lent money, represented by the 7th house. The native's 12th house is the 6th reckoned from the 7th, and so has to do with discharge of debts. Suppose one has lent money to someone. In his horoscope, the 7th house shows the person to whom the money has been lent. The 12th house of the native, being the 6th reckoned from the 7th, indicates an increase in income to the person denoted by the 7th house, and a deterioration in the native's bank position. Therefore, one may lend money to others and thus incur expenses. Whether such expenses will be pleasant and expected or unpleasant and unexpected will depend upon the nature and lordship of the planets found in the 12th house, or of the planets in any manner connected with the 12th house. Such results will come to pass only when the period or subperiod of the significators connected with the 12th house operate, and not at all times. Furthermore, it is not the occupation or lordship of the 12th house that matters most. What is more important is the constellation (nakshatra) in which a planet is posited in the 12th house, and what houses are owned by the constellation lord to that particular horoscope. A planet in the 12th house in the constellation of, say, lords of 2 and 9, portrays long journeys and separation from family and going to a place far removed from home. Sorrow and sin, division and segregation, obstacles and impediments in one's way, misery and misfortune, poverty and persecution, intrigue and imprisonment, and secret toil of mind are some of the unfortunate matters coming under the influence of the 12th house.

The 12th House and Fear
The 12th house has a relation to fear, inferiority complex, anxiety, misgivings, and suspicion. It is known as the house of solitude, secret and silent suffering, and self-undoing. The 6th house focuses on ordinary service or help given to others, while the 12th house represents profound service rendered to mankind. The 12th house rules the extremities and shows the amount of freedom one enjoys and the degree to which one must submerge their own personality in service to other people. It is through the 12th house that one must decide all questions regarding seclusion and social barriers, the limitations and restrictions in one's way, and the unseen or unexpected troubles that one may suffer from. More appropriately, it is the house of the greatest self-sacrifice and shows unselfish deeds unconsciously prompted by conscience, likely as amends for wrongs committed in previous lives.

The 6th House According to Our Sages

Our sages have related the 6th house to inimical activity of an open nature, such as petty quarrels. It would be illogical to ascribe to the 7th house someone who is dearest to the native, such as a married partner, and in the same breath call it the house of open enemies. The 7th house stands for those who compete with the native in elections, litigation, etc., but who are not unfriendly towards the native, so they cannot be dubbed as inimical.

The 12th house is the 4th house reckoned from the 9th, which rules the higher mind. Counting inversely, it is the 4th house from the 3rd, which is concerned with lower or ordinary mental processes. Therefore, the 12th house has to do with secret workings of the mind. It has a bearing on such things as secret plots and schemes, conspiracy and cunningness, envy and malice, fraud and treachery, intrigue and deception, and suicide, murder, or assassination. It is also connected with exile and extradition and matters concerning these.

Neptune is associated with secrecy, mystery, mediumship, psychic research, and occult investigations. When Neptune is in a good position with other planets, it brings success in matters carried out in secret. The native is best suited for detective work and will gain through secluded and quiet methods. If Neptune is afflicted, it can lead to confinement in a hospital due to a chronic disease or insanity, detention in prison or a public institution, and many secret enemies. It can also indicate nefarious schemes, deception, fraud, scandal, disgrace, and secret sorrows. One may live in vague dread of some unknown danger.

Uranus Occupying 12th House and Well-Aspected

Uranus occupying the 12th house and being well-aspected tends to success through occult affairs and the invention of chemical processes which remain secret, even when promoted by the planet. If afflicted, it denotes danger from animals, accidents causing detention in out-of-sight places, disgrace and troubles from psychic or occult sources, sudden illness defying diagnosis, restraint in public institutions, and even exile from the country. One may face strange and sudden enmities and feel irritated and annoyed by the underhanded actions of eccentric people.

Saturn, the Planet of Seclusion, placed in the 12th House and well-aspected, points to success in seclusion or laborious occupations. If Saturn is possessed of strength by sign, position, etc., it shows that seclusion is self-invited. Taken alone, the position shows that secret enemies will steadily work for the downfall of the native. There is the likelihood of danger or contusions and bruises through animals. Saturn rules reserve and restriction, so one is inclined to prefer work in a quiet and peaceful way, unnoticed by others. If Saturn is afflicted, some lingering illness to the partner is denoted, as it is the 6th House reckoned from the 7th. If Mars seriously afflicts, there is the liability to danger of violence, robbery, or even suicide. Mercury rules the mental system and its affliction to Saturn causes mental disorder; also loss by theft, etc.

"Uranus in an adverse aspect is a very bad indication, as all the malefic matters mentioned in regard to the 12th house will come to the fore."

The Benevolent and Philanthropic Jupiter Well-Aspected in the 12th House

The well-aspected Jupiter in the 12th house gives one gain and success through occupations carried on in seclusion, such as in asylums, hospitals, and public or philanthropic institutions. It ensures success in places remote from the place of birth and with large animals. Jupiter in 12 enables one to eventually succeed over enemies and gain from them. Jupiter is expansive in nature, and those having Jupiter in 12 will be recipients of large aid from charitable institutions. If they are already rich, they will give away lavishly to those in need and to philanthropic institutions.

Mars in 12th House and Well-Aspected

Mars in the 12th house, when well-aspected, makes one an administrator of an estate or in a public institution. Generally, Mars here causes trouble through impulse, loss of reputation or treachery from enemies or misplaced affection. If afflicted, it portends danger of violence from enemies in a fight and danger of injuries through large animals. Mars has influence over violence and blood. The 12th house is connected with large animals and beasts, so effusion of blood can be expected as a result of kicks or thrusts from animals if there is affliction to Mars. This is suggested by way of a brief to the discerning students as to how to blend the nature of the house and the characteristics of a planet and one should not rush to a conclusion "Oh! Mars is for violence and 12th house shows animals. So danger of violence through animals is denoted." 

If Mars is well dignified by sign position and connected with the Sun and the 10th house, one may serve as a surgeon in a hospital (Mars for surgery, Sun for medicine). One's station in life should also be borne in mind before coming to a conclusion. If one were connected with a circus company and had a period of Mars in 12, weak by sign and by house ownership and the planet afflicting Mars, then one can expect danger of violence from animals and even death. In fact, in the horoscope of one gentleman connected with the circus, there were afflictions to Mars in 12 and on a certain day when he was playing with a lion in the circus ring, he was kicked and mauled by it.

Mars in 12th house, seriously afflicted by Saturn, may lead to imprisonment or illness caused by lingering disease and confinement in a hospital for a long time. If a factory manager were to have Mars in this position, then he will have recurring labour troubles often and the labour class will secretly work for his downfall.

Venus in the 12th House

Venus in the 12th house, when well aspected, contributes to success in occupations connected with jails, hospitals, or charitable institutions, or by work in a chemical laboratory. One may also benefit by pursuing obscure occupations. This placement of Venus may also incline one to investigate the secret arts or study and practice the occult. Venus, the planet of love in this house, makes one love and enjoy voluntary seclusion. One may also find pleasure in dealing with large animals, such as horses, and may enjoy hunting. The 12th house also indicates "suha sayanam," which suggests comfort in bed. Generally, this position of Venus makes one go after the opposite sex, and if Venus is afflicted, it can lead to enmity with women. Neptune or Uranus afflicting Venus suggests peculiar love affairs and sudden changes of affections, leading to sorrow, suspicion, disappointment, and divorce. Saturn afflicting Venus is said to cause separation generally, while Mars makes one a moral wreck, overindulging in passions. If Venus is in the 12th house, identical with Scorpio (Vrischika), and is afflicted, then it can indicate confinement in a hospital due to a disease caused by overindulgence of passions, as Scorpio rules the generative organs. Taurus also governs, by reflex action, self-abuse. Therefore, even if Venus occupies its own sign, Taurus, in the 12th house, it will, if severely afflicted, force one to undergo hospital treatment for venereal complaints.

If Mercury is in this House
If Mercury is in this house, it gives a mind peculiarly suited to delve into the mysteries and success in scientific or occult research. When well aspected by Mars and Saturn, who are themselves dignified by occupation, one will be admirably suited to detective work. Mercury has to do with publicity, but the 12th house shows limitations and so one is better fitted to out-of-sight work and occupations requiring seclusion rather than sociability and publicity. Mercury is an intellectual planet and will certainly give one the faculty to go into the most intricate details in matters which seem trivial or microscopic to others. Harmonious aspects from Herschel enable one to pursue unusual lines of thought.

If afflicted, especially by malefics like Saturn or Mars, it points to nefarious schemes, forgeries, plots, and conspiracies. Take alone, Mercury here indicates petty worries, annoyance, and small enmities caused by writings or scandalous reports, as Mercury rules correspondence. The mind is self-absorbed and narrow.

Sun in 12, Dignified and Well-Aspected

Sun in 12, when dignified and well-aspected, secures one success in occult and psychic matters and gives uncommon tastes. Sun is otherwise called Dhanwantari and so work in hospitals is favored. One loves and succeeds in some quiet, secure but obscure occupation such as in a chemical laboratory or in prisons or other institutions of confinement. A well-aspected Sun in 12 is a sure sign of sympathies and self-sacrifice and that one will rise steadily out of obscurity due to one's own merit and effort. Scholars say that Sun here vanquishes enemies.

Generally, Sun in 12, when weak by sign and afflicted, shows enmity of influential people, life in remote places, and separation from one's kith and kin.

Moon Rules the Public
Moon rules the public, and its situation in this house of seclusion and solitude favors success in such work as it is performed in hospitals or prisons, provided it is well-aspected. Moon is emotional and inconstant, and changeful, and consequently there is a liability of the senses dominating reason, involving one in clandestine love affairs. However, if Moon is in a fixed sign and well-aspected, one will keep the secret to himself.

Moon Rules Voyage
Moon also rules voyage. If Moon is in a watery sign in the 12th house, one may be connected with an occupation concerning shipping, etc. This indication is strengthened if the Moon is in conjunction with, or receives a favorable aspect from Neptune, the Sea Lord. An afflicted Moon in the 12th house signifies limitations, hindrances, fanciful fears, enforced retirement or sickness due to acts of indiscretion; also petty enmities with womenfolk causing worry and trouble. According to Haly, "it represents banished persons, male-factors, lost goods never recovered, long hidden wrath, vile persons, reproaches and disobedience."

Adila and Zeal, two very ancient Western astrologers, remark that the twelfth house is the house of captives and imprisonment; the place of imprisonment and the person that is imprisoned. The author of Phaladeepika calls this house "Leenasthana," meaning a hidden house. The twelfth house has to be examined in matters concerning occultism and the hidden side of life. Alan Leo observes thus: "The twelfth is related to the psychic mind in which receptivity or mental sensitiveness to the unseen world is awakened. Therefore, it is known as the house of self-undoing, which, in some cases, may mean the breaking up of the concrete physical condition by leaning towards the occult side of things. It is the house of 'one occultism.' The twelfth house, then, may denote sorrow in matters of an external, purely physical type; trouble and difficulty in matters of an emotional character; annoyance, worry, and anxiety in matters intellectual or mental, but in this relation, it may also bring joy and peace.

Mantreswara states that the 12th house rules 'Sayana'. Therefore, one must investigate this house to determine whether they will have sound sleep or not. The third house shows one's awakening from sleep, the 6th house signifies trance, and the 9th relates to dreams. Kalidasa differs in this respect, as in Uttara Kalamritam he states that the 12th house also indicates 'Nithra banga' or awakening from sleep or disturbance to sleep. If one runs the period of a malefic planet placed in the 12th house and afflicted by others, how can they expect a sound and peaceful sleep?

In Uttara Kalamritam it has been mentioned that the 12th house has to be referred to in connection with paternal wealth. This is likely because the 4th house indicates one's permanent possessions, and the 12th house is the 4th from the 9th representing the father, thus denoting the father's permanent possessions which may pass on to the native after the father's death. The Moon is always for change, and so one's father may change their residence when the Moon is in the 12th house, which is the 4th house counted from the 9th. Such changes will take place when the native runs the Moon's period or sub-period.

According to Kalidasa, one must investigate the 12th house accounts for the following: mental pain and agitation; the feet; the left eye; fear from enemies; mutilation of a limb; bodily injury; harm; wretchedness; imprisonment; anger; elephants; horses; loss by marriage and loss of wife; a blow to the thought of the happiness of parents or brothers; going to another place; liberation from pain; discharge of debts; paternal wealth; renouncing couch, termination of appointment, death, entry into heaven, and expenditure in various ways. Vaidyanatha Dikshitar says in his work "Jataka Parijatham" that visits to far-off places have to be predicted with reference to the 12th bhava. He adds that an individual's dignity, comfort of bed, sayana, etc., misfortune, and waste of wealth have to be ascertained from the strength of the 12th house, its lord, and Saturn, the karaka or the chief governor for the 12th house matters. He asserts that if the wandering Moon is in 12th identical with a movable sign or aspected by Saturn, then one will roam about. A waxing Moon receiving beneficial aspects makes one liberal and philanthropic. He will be virtuously disposed and will indulge in doing meritorious deeds. He may also be engaged in agriculture. A Moon favourably aspected by the passionate Venus gives comforts of bed.

Ramadayalu mentions in Sanketanidhi that the twelfth house rules the feet. He further states that this is the house of vyaya, or loss. Loss may also refer to a deterioration in the person's financial position. Suppose one has beneficial aspects in their horoscope between the lords of the eighth and twelfth houses, and they have taken out a loan.
