## PREFACE
"Why is this book necessary when there are already many books on astrology available in the world?" This is a question that may be asked. The answer to this question is provided in the introduction to this book. In India, there are many different astrological systems and none of them agree with each other. As a result, the positions of the planets calculated by different astrologers can differ from one another. Astrologers in India rely on almanacs, and each astrologer prepares a horoscope based on these almanacs. Even if two astrologers are given the same time of birth, the horoscopes they produce may not agree. This can be confusing for the person whose horoscope is being prepared, as they may not know which horoscope is correct. Some astrologers do not know how to correctly calculate a horoscope even when given the same time of birth, and the preparation of a horoscope is simply a mathematical calculation. It is important that the same horoscope be given to a person, regardless of who prepares it. A few astrologers do not even consider the importance of the place of birth, including the latitude and longitude, in their calculations.

Sripathi Padhdhati provides a thorough understanding of various calculations. There is no evidence to suggest that Sripathi studied the Western system of astrology before writing his book. It can be assumed that he was only familiar with the traditional Indian system and based his book on this knowledge. In the past, there were no scientific instruments available for calculating the positions of the planets, but now we have various instruments, including telescopes, that allow us to create accurate ephemerides. Therefore, it is not advisable to rely on almanacs to create a horoscope when more accurate methods are available. What we need is a correct chart.

In India, many astrological authors follow the traditional system without attempting to improve it. They do not provide a method for making predictions based on the movement of the rising point degree by degree. While there are some systems that consider minute divisions, they do not fully explain the principles behind these divisions, making it difficult for astrologers to use them for prediction. It is unclear if there is any astrologer in the world who can accurately predict events using the Nadis system in a person's life.

The discovery of Krishnamurti Padhdhati has shown the importance of creating a horoscope that is accurate to the degree and minute. Using the available almanacs to create a horoscope can lead to incorrect positions and failed predictions. Krishnamurti Padhdhati offers both the nature and timing of events accurately. To correctly predict events using Krishnamurti Padhdhati, it is necessary to use the Krishnamurti Padhdhati Ayanamsas. Other Ayanamsas, particularly those that vary significantly, will not be useful if you are following the K.P. system.

This book explains how to create a correct horoscope and is titled "First Reader." It was written based on suggestions made by scholars in Banjar, Kola Valley, and Himachal Pradesh during a visit a few years ago. It may not be easy for some people, who blindly follow traditional astrology without questioning it, to switch to a more accurate system. However, it is up to each individual to decide whether to read a book and follow its teachings or to think critically, choose the correct information, and apply it. It is up to the wiser students to decide which is the correct one. The author hopes that this book will be useful for those who are interested in astrology and will help to clear up any confusion about the various systems.
